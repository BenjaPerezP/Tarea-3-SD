He is the right one if they start winning more.\n\nLook at KSU where they bring in a coach after the Synder era and people all had doubts...but he pulled it into a winning season. It doesn't matter until people let that coach prove yes or no whether they can win.

Jay-Z by far. Diddy may be the better promoter in terms of hyping things up and relating to the people, but Jay is the better businessman. He basically owns the nets, has the Rocawear clothing line which is booming in the clothing industry, he has multi million advertising deals with Budweisier and Dell, and he is now President and CEO of Def Jam records, the biggest of all recording industrys. He has much more money and is well on his way to being the first rap billionaire, and will become this in our lifetime.
Our problem is the number of people who have no basic concept of what evolution actually is. The poster above, who answers a question on evolution with something about astrophysics instead of biology, is an excellent example of this ignorance. A questioner yesterday asked nine questions about evolution, and only the last one actually had anything to do with evolution theory. It's troubling to see this, especially when you see the same person make the same claims after having been corrected.
He declared himself dictator for life. This act, along with his continual effort to adorn himself with the trappings of power, turned many in the Senate against him. Sixty members of the Senate concluded that the only resolution to the problem was to assassinate Caesar.

I would recommend saving the card. I mean you paid what, $4 for the pack? So right now it's a $6 profit. Give the kid a few years to build up a better resume. Yes having a superbowl ring is great. On the other hand, he is not considered a pro-bowl Quarterback as of now. I bet in about 5yrs. That card will be worth 5-10 times the amount it is now.

(in literary/creative arts) It is the part in your paper where you write expressions of gratitude. You thank people/organization that helped/assisted you in writing/creating a literary or artistic work (be it in the form of encouragement/moral or spiritual support, technical support, critism/editorial support, idea/conceptual support, funding/financial support, etc.).\n\n(in law/legal matters) It is a declaration or avowal of one's own act, to give it legal validity; as, the acknowledgment of a deed before a proper officer. The term also refers to the certificate of the officer attesting such declaration.
An unconventional lifestyle, you say? Well, whose to say? Unconventional to society as a whole? To a religious group? In general, one can argue that all lifestyles can be classified as unconventional.\n\nSociety tends to hold the idea of an unconventional lifestyle as one that is separated from society. Loving art, nature, etc. more that wealth, success, etc. is a good example. For Bohemians, they rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth. They also rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom. \nThey rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not. \nTo most societies, this is an unconventional lifestyle.
No it hasn't changed my mind.\nSome of us have known this for a long time.\n\nbut hopefully it will affect some.
Electricity is the migration of free electrons form a highly negatively charged area to a positively charged area. When you rub your woolly socked feet on the wood floor and touch your your sister's ear, she gets a shock because you built up a negative charge compared to her charge level. so the electrons jumped over from you to her. These electrons can flow along any medium including air, as in Lightening. Even through space if the forces were strong enough. When you send electricity through a wire, the resistance of the wire and the wire itself absorb the free electron charge. It can go as far as the strength, or voltage, of the charge will push it against the resistance. We used to send phone messages across the oceans by wire so the longest we've done here on earth could be considered as many times the circumference of the earth. In short, there is really no limit as to how far you can transmit an electrical current. It will just take a lot more power to send it farther.

Before modern refrigeration, people kept food in cool cellars or lowered them into wells in a bucket. Even earlier, they stored food in caves and cold springs. Later, farmers cut large blocks of ice in winter and stored them in insulated icehouses, which were then used to preserve food in summer. Commercial icehouses delivered blocks of ice to homes and businesses in the cities until the advent of the modern, mechanical refrigerator in the 20th century.

Americans have just lost the loyalty of American businessmen who would rather get filthy rich then show their patriotism by employing fellow Americans. I think the government needs to stop accepting payoffs and begin banning products produced by American companies who do not have their factories inside the USA, and who do not employ American citizens.

Immediately after world war two, Germany was divided in to two, West Germany which was controlled by Usa, Britian and France whilst East Germany was in the hands of the USSR (Soviet Union) Under Control of Stalin.\nIt was thought of as the front line because both sides, The Allies and the Soviet Union had troops amassed on either side. Behind East Germany were all the terrorities under the control of the Soviet Union which they had captured during world war two and similarly behind West Germany were Countries the USA, Britian and allies had liberated from the Nazi's.\nThere was also a wall erected over the years by the East Germans known as "the Berlin wall" which divided East from West Germany

In the premiership a goal keeper would make more in a week than YOUR teacher makes in a year. But look at it this way you probably have the same amount of teachers as there are goalies in the premiership. How many schools are in your town and how many towns are in your country, so any tom, dick, or harry can be a teacher but you need to be something special to be a premiership goal keeper.
Yeah, take the week off. Let it heal.

Good question actually. A reputable dive shop shouldn't be selling them to a non certified diver. They have a reg similar to that used on a set of normal regs, which require some training on, to be familiar with it's use and limitations. You also need to be familiar with how a compressed gas works on the body and some of the physics involved.\n There are a couple of sizes of spare air, so gas volume will be part of how long a can will last as well as the depth it's used at.\n Mine is the 3 cubic foot (largest I think) and allegedly holds 50 typical breaths when used at the surface. This number goes down substantially when you hit 2 atm and so on. About 25% per atm approximately. I don't think they are what you want, for what you intend on doing. They are refillable, but I don't think the cost is worth it for you overall. Mine's sole purpose is to get me out of a tight spot, should the need arise. Fortunately (knock on wood) I haven't had to take it out of the holster.\n You could get certified for just a little more than the cost of one of these. Just a thought.
She is scared to death of you and of loving you right now because you hurt her deeply. You chose to leave her rather than stick it out and work through this issue. That creates a giant trust issue in your relationship. Now she probably is scared that any time you two argue you are just going to walk out and leave her. She is probably also thinking that even though you say you are now ok with not having kids that at some point you are going to regret never having kids and blame her. So she thinks it is better just to go ahead and end this so you can have the kids you want and you can both be happy without each other.

Metal only needs one thing to rust, oxygen. Water and salt are catalyst, but really it's metal oxidizing. Paint helps prevent rust because it keeps oxygen from making contact with metal.\n\nSo metal will rust more when there is a lot of heat and oxygen (heat speeds the oxidization).

I did a paper on global warming and there are a few things to do to not increase global warming but I do not know that anything can be done to slow. The ways are same things you hear over and over, recycle, fuel efficient cars, factories owners finding different types of fuels to run the factories, stop pollution from air, which is also from factories, cars- so carpooling would help or public transportation, water- people dumping trash into bodies of water also they tend to throw things in like containers of oils and stuff like that, land- littering.

I don't get offended. If you want to fly the flag of another country, this is the land of the free, go for it. I probably will get a bunch of thumbs down for this opinion, but if you think about it, flying a flag of another country is not showing disrespect for America. It is showing pride in where they came from, but not disrespect of America. I was born and bred here in the US. I can trace back my lines to my american Indian heritage, and also to my English heritage. However, my husband is from Honduras. I, not him, but me, bought a Honduras flag, and it is hanging in our children's room. I also bought one of those flags that go onto the windshield of our car - and it was a Honduras flag. But that doesn't mean that I am showing any disrespect for America.
To say that I'm jealous of you would imply that you have something that I want, but can't have. That isn't the case at all. I have something YOU want, and can't have. So you try to TAKE it. My defense of what I have is not jealousy. It's not even in the same dictionary as jealousy. Maybe you should learn the language before you try to use big words you don't understand. Now, if you want to be an American, and have a better life, good for you. Try starting by NOT breaking our laws. And then try being an AMERICAN. Not a MEXICAN in America. Assimilate yourself. Become one of us. Bring us your heritage, but leave Mexico in Mexico. That goes for your language, and your flag. But trust me, I'm NOT jealous of you. I'm simply ANNOYED by you.

Unfortunately University of Phoenix gets a bad rap. The truth is the school is Regionally Accredited and has the SAME accredidation as Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University (Along with Yale, Harvard and all your other well knowns). The school is private, tax payers are not funding part of the tuition therefore it can be more costly to attend. Online education is becoming so wide spread, that "brick and mortar" Universities (Arizona State for example) are scrambling to give people the online education that they are desperately seeking. I have personal experience with UOP and really, if you cannot attend school at a ground campus it is a fabulous solution. The only bad experiences I've heard of is people thinking they are ready to get thier degree and they aren't, and now have student loans to pay off. Education is a huge investment, and worth every penny. In a year I should be done with my Masters of Business at University of Phoenix, I recieved my Bachelors at ASU, and because of the convenience of online, I prefer UOP. If you aren't ready or willing to do what it takes to get your degree, you are wasting your time and money no matter where you go.
it can be fun if you take it light heartedly. My experiences were that it was nice women similar to me, but the men were all 10-15 years older than us, and the few that seemed interesting, originally lied about their careers, their divorces and other things.\n\nit's a novel way to meet people, but realize it's more of a meat market than the bar usually is!!

Poverty can be understood as having less than you need, just as wealth is having more than you can earn, or inherit.\nPoverty dominates your life. Wealth dominates your soul.
it depends!! i mean on civil matters like marriage, divorce and inheretance it applies for Muslims only. but for offenses (criminal) like Murder, rape, etc. it applies for all. because it's a part of the Law of the land (state law).
the first thing you have to do is create a paper trail for the police and then get a restraining order and then get a home protection device weather it be pepper spray or an alarm system or a gun if thats what you want and you are of age. then get into a self defence class. protect yourself first possesion second and the rest will be fine. good luck.

Wow. Lotsa issues for you to work out. You need to start by answering some basic questions for yourself: \n\n-- How much money will you have to live on? \n-- What inescapable expenses will you have? (E.g., rent, tuition, books, insurance?)\n\nWhen you know what your "disposable" income will be, then look for things where you have control. Take transportation: Any public transportation is cheaper than keeping a car. Riding a bike or walking are cheapest of all. So it's worth spending a little bit more on rent to live close to work and school, for instance. \n\nAs for jobs, your choices are going to be dictated by your school schedule and your skills. All things being equal, consider fringe benefits like paid vacation days, sick leave, free or discounted goods and services. If you can get a job with the school where you are studying, that's usually a great deal. It saves you commuting costs and time, and may get you a break on tuition. \n\nAs far as feeding yourself, first consider any special nutritional needs you may have (allergies, etc.), then learn how to cook the basics. It takes no great skill to boil spaghetti or scramble an egg. A microwave is a great tool for making things like ramen noodles (one of those cheap basics you can eat every day, with variations). Fresh veggies and fruit are quite inexpensive, compared to anything prepared, carry-out or frozen. Same with meats, although if you are really pinched, you will need to explore all the meat alternatives -- beans and rice, for instance, have tons of protein. There's always tofu, if you can stomach it (I can't). Work in a little indulgence here and there -- some real butter, homemade brownies, an occasional bottle of wine, whathave you -- to keep you happy. You don't want to feel like a prisoner. But, man, watch out for beer. College students the world over go broke and fry their brains on "cheap" beer.\n\nSpend a little time in the cookbook section of the local library and find a good, basic guide, like "Cooking for Dummies," or any one of a ton of cheap-eats books. Make sure you pick a book that is understandable and appealing to you; if you're confused, you won't use it.\n\nWatch out for sodas, chips, snacks, etc. Ounce for ounce, they are very expensive and do your body no good.\n\nOtherwise, you need to think about things like entertainment. Can you live without movies, DVDs, video games, new CDs? If not, put yourself on a fun budget, and explore what you can find for free at the library, and for cheap at used-goods stores.\n\nAlso, study the local newpapers, weeklies and entertainment guides. There are always tons of cool, free or low-cost things to do in a great city like Vancouver. You can have massive amounts of fun and meet fabulous people by seeking out the cheapo fun. (Beware of cults; they give away a lot of free food.)\n\nIf you have a clothes jones or gadget habit, again, you'll need to put yourself on a strict budget. It's impulse spending that will land you in big trouble. Find out where all the thrift stores in town are, and go there first when you need something. Never buy anything on store credit.\n\nIf you can get by without one, do not get a credit card. If you must have one, do NOT use it except for EXTREME emergencies.\n\nLiving alone can be disconcerting for someone who has grown up with people around all the time. But it's also a great adventure. It forces you to learn a lot about yourself, and it forces you to go out and make friends. Just don't do anything incredibly dumb, and you will have such a great time during these years that you won't miss money at all.

9. I get a 'Power calibration error' or 'Calibration area (almost) full' error message. Why?\n\nPower Calibration is controlled by the recorder.\n\nBefore any write operation, all recorders must do a 15 step power test to determine the optimum power for writing to the CD; this is called "Optimum Power Calibration"(OPC). During the write, it continues to do this test to get the best write throughout the whole CD; this is called "Running Optimum Power Calibration" (ROPC).\nThis whole process is controlled by the recorder, though initiated by programs such as Nero. There is an area on the inner part of the CD for the test and test data info to be stored. You can use this area up to 999 times.\n\nIf you receive the "Power calibration error" or "Power calibration area is (amost) full" error message, the cause will be either poor media, poor power, or a defective recorder.\n\nPlease try the following solutions:\n\n * Update the firmware of your recorder. Please check the manufacturer's website for the latest version.\n * Try another brand of CD-R or CD-RW media.\n * Try different power connectors, and for recorders, do not share power with other devices. It needs its own power connector. If the error occurs with an external recorder, the power source in the chassis could be the cause. As a test, try to take the recorder out of the external chassis and connect it internal.\n * Try different configurations, such as taking the CD-ROM to the primary IDE bus as slave and have only the recorder connected to the secondary IDE bus as master.\n * Send the recorder in for service.

i teach english as a second language. I have done so for years and in several countries. I dont think that we should pick these words apart to decide what it means. Look at the situations that native speakers use phrase. what are they're feelings when they say it. In my experience people say this to people they care about. They want this person to be happy and enjoy their life. maybe they feel they work too much.\nor, it is often the case that they want that person to go out that day. when the reply is, " i cant, im busy" one often hears, "you work too hard".\nbut really, it is mostly said as a parting line....another way to say goodbye. like take it easy

Hahaha! Right, you go for it man! No fear!\n\nFor real though, that is the stupidest idea ever.
What's wrong with it is that every number has two square roots. The validity of the manipulation √(xy) →√x√y is derived from the equality (xy)² = x²y². However, this equality also holds for (-xy)², so all you can really say about √x√y is that it is equal to ±√(xy). Thus, all you have managed to prove is that -1=±1, which is true, since -1=-1.

The bone will heal on its own. Those are probably one of the few displaced fractures that doesn't require surgery. I don't know how old your mom is, but those in their60's and 70's tend to heal a little slower. Women also have the unfortunate condition called osteoporosis when they get older, which will also slow down the healing time. \n\nLike I mentioned, not all fractures or breaks require surgical repair. Clavicle fractures (collar bone) will be left in their broken position and sent home to follow up with an orthopaedic doctor.

you can't "ban" anyone from myspace; that's the site administration's job. but, you can prevent the person from sending you messages (by going to his page and clicking "block") and/or prevent him from viewing your page (by going to "account setting">privacy setting>change setting>who can view my full profile>my friends only. when you do this, you will also prevent people who are not on your friends list from seeing your profile as well. so, in short, you can't just ban one person from seeing your page).

If i could imagine, i would say like the drums in Africa as they beat the drums that could be heard from village to village each village taking it farther and farther to its destination..sometimes the enemy would hear it,(hackers). progress called computers have the same problems (hackers) life repeats itself, is we only really looked in a place called the third eye, or vision, for there is nothing new under the sun....most times we dont catch on till we are nearing what we call the end of life....which could start in our 50's unless remain a fool all of our life

Either one is just fine but if you're only going to be looking at the moon and solar system objects (e.i. the planets), you probably don't need the Go To feature. Everything in the solar system is bright and easy to find.. The Go To is only needed for finding dim objects. I would consider giving up the Go To for better optics. The eye pieces with these scopes are small. Standard eyepieces are 1 1/4 inch these are .96 " so they'll be tougher to look through. Do you have a college/science center that has an astronomy club ?? They could be the best source for help.
God says that man shall not be judged by what he puts in his mouth, but what comes out of his mouth because that is what comes from the heart. It is not good to over eat, and we should treat these bodies as vessels for the Holy Sprit, but we have no "nos" or "yes" on what to eat or drink.
Only IDENTICAL twins share the same DNA...Fraternal twins have their own unique DNA. Here is the proof:\n\n"DNA is a cellular acid that carries an individual's unique genetic code. Identical twins are formed from the same fertilized egg and are thought to be the only people with virtually identical genetic profiles." \n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-06-03-twins-dna_x.htm\n\n"The DNA profiles for identical twins will be identical."\n\nhttp://www.genetree.com/product/twin-dna-testing.asp\n\n"Identical twins, formed when one fertilized egg splits, are the only people in the world with identical DNA. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, are formed when two different eggs are fertilized. Genetically speaking, fraternal twins are no closer than normal siblings, sharing only about 50% of their genes." \n\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20010213.html\n\n"As everyone knows, there are two kinds of twin, fraternal and identical. Fraternal twins develop from two independently fertilized eggs, so their DNA is different. Identical twins are a different story. If you and your sibling are identical twins, then you two were pretty close--so close that at one point you were a single cell together, a fertilized egg known as a "zygote." Usually a zygote, with its complete set of DNA, divides into two cells, then the two cells divide into four, the four into eight, and so on until a human being is formed (OK, that was simplified, but we'll be here for a semester otherwise). The DNA in each cell is identical."\n\nhttp://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mtwinsdna.html\n\nI guess that is enough evidence! lol
Depends if the new tax here goes into affect after today's votes are counted, if so you're looking at about $7 to $8 a pack.

Maybe not severe, but it annoys me to see obvious homework questions out there. I guess if they simply can't find the answer in the textbook, and they use Answers infrequently, it probably won't hurt. I'd be worrying about people deliberately giving me false answers.
In theory because they have the highest skills, the most experience, the most responsibility, and they make the final decisions.\n\nIt is a nice theory, but debatable.
the only thing more dangerous than someone with bad credit is someone with no credit. they are wary of you since you have no established credit, your a student blah blah blah. it takes them awhile to verify your status, residence, job (if you have one), and your account status. if you had established credit then it wouldn;t necessarily take this long to approve or deny your application. if you do get this one and are financilly responsible; when you apply for other cards in the future, the response time will be a lot quicker. basically, once they can pin you down, see you can make payments, you'll get it.
Just because you don't have credit yet doesn't mean that you can't get an apartment. They'll require references, as well as proof of sufficient income to pay the rent. You'll have to put up the usual security deposit and first month's rent. Some states allow landlords to collect first and last month's rent in advance so you may have to come up with that.\n\nI used to rent some properties out and never accepted or asked for a cosignor. More hassle than it was worth. \n\nEspecially with younger prospective tenants, their look and behavior (clean and neat, well spoken, etc. NOT race!) would usually factor in. For the most part they didn't meet my standard qualifications so saying no was entirely defensible.\n\nOnce you do get accepted, be a good tenant! That will help you well into the future. Pay your rent on time, stick to the terms of your lease, keep things neat and orderly, keep the parties to a minimum and the noise to zero.
Check your yellow pages for stores that sell used cd. Sometimes you can bring in cds that you don't listen to anymore and trade them in for others. But, cash is accepted everywhere.

Go to any store and buy something. Then read what the label says. Usually it says "made in China". If you stop trading with them, you won't get the microwave or toaster or the laptop or the memory chip inside the laptop or the iPod or the shirt or the sneakers.. and you will become like the people in Africa. Because when you send manufacturing jobs abroad, you stop and tear down the factories and stop training the labor force, and stop producing the capital goods needed to make the factory again and stop training the labor force to build those capital goods.. and so on. It's a long chain backwards: the supply chain. You don't have a supply chain anymore. Just like Africa. What you do have is money to buy the products from that supply chain. In order to keep your civilization alive, you need China. Or you could rebuild the industries in the USA from scratch. That would take another 50 years again.
We like to say "match the bug, with the drug". Penicillin was one of the first antibiotics. It was widely prescribed and used. With new and better technology, scientists have discovered other drugs that are more sophistocated to treat certain infections. While yes it is true over prescription of antibiotics, not just penicillin, can cause tolerance, I believe in part the fact that technology has caught up with infections and we have the right medicine to treat them.
Well, think about what you enjoy doing, even if it doesn't typically turn into a career. What were your favorite subjects in school? What are your hobbies? Figure out what you like to do outside of work, and then figure out a creative way to use that talent in a career. \n\nFor example, if you love working out, try working for a company that manufactures athletic gear, or as a personal trainer. Some of your ideas may require going back to school or getting a license, but do it anyways. It'll be more than worth it when you're happy with what you're doing!

Sorry to hear about that.\nFrom what I've read, it appears that YOU are the adult and your mom is the child.\nWhat is the relationship with your dad?\nIf you can talk with him about your concerns, do so.\nHe probably has a lot of hostile feelings towards your mom, and it sounds like he's justified in doing so...but remind him that HE is the PARENT and YOU are the CHILD in NEED of answers.\nSomeone, somewhere in your family has to act responsible.\notherwise, I hope you have access to family counseling..it may help you learn how to respond to your mom.\nI DOUBT your mom would be mature enough to recognize the fact that she NEEDs professional help...but you could suggest it to her.\nI wish you well.

It is a difficult call because after any pregnancy - whether live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage or abortion, one still sees positive home pregnancy tests for up to eight weeks following the birth or loss. \n\nThe only way to determine if you are in fact pregnant right now would be to ask for a blood test. If your levels are up, you will be asked to return the following week to see if those initial levels have doubled. If that happens, you are pregnant. If the levels stay the same or drop, you may have been recently pregnant again or just have lingering hCG hormone in your bloodstream from your last pregnancy\nhttp://www.anairhoads.org/bc/pregabort.shtml
If you continue to have bleeding, then there may be some tissue that didn't get expelled from the uterus. As long as the bleeding is scant, you can probably just wait and see if the bleeding stops on it's own. If the bleeding continues, the only thing to do at that point would be a D&C.

keep that tattoo as clean as possible. the salt from your sweat i would imagine would get into the fresh wound and sorta exfoliate it and may dull the color and/or cause infection. talk to a tattoo artist for the best answer. also, you dont want your clothes to be rubbing on the fresh tattoo. that will irritate it and can cause infection. i suggest if you get the tattoo on friday to stay away from dancing for a few weeks.
I am not turned on by black men AT all.

The shapes of cars has changed to allow them to become more aerodynamic, which in turn allows them to use less gas because they can move through the air easier, thereby saving gas. The shape of the car also attracts consumers because the curves remind them of futuristic cars of the future from science fiction movies. The wind tunnel effect is simply how much air resistance the body of a car has.

same as most people I'd think. I don't know of any diseases that occur more often for that culture. Ireland is a Christian based society, so anything that would not be acceptable to the Christian community should be avoided. Each patient is an individual, so ask about last rites, birth control use, stem cell use, etc. and know a religious figure such as a priest or nun that you could contact with questions, or refer a patient to if they need a bit of spiritual guidance as well as medical.

Let me say first that a lot of things that you find on the internet are incorrect/outdated. For example: http://www.coolnurse.com/marriage_laws.htm states that in GA a pregnant minor can marry without parental consent. They USED to be able to, but GA has now changed that law and pregnant minors can no longer marry in GA without parental consent.\n\nAnd DON’T run off and get pregnant thinking that you will then be able to get married or obtain permission from a judge to get married, because it’s usually denied. A pregnancy ALONE does not automatically mean that marriage is in the best interest of the minor and is not normally a sufficient enough reason for a judge to override a parents rights/wishes by granting a minor permission to marry when their parents object to it.\n\nAnd as far as emancipation, which is VERY hard to obtain by the way, there are states where emancipation does not give a minor the right to get married. \n\nAt 18 you can get married.
Well, if you are in the United States, if it is determined she need special ed, they are legally obligated to provide it. In other countries the rules might be different, but I believe that in most developed countries the public schools are required to provide a program to meet your child's needs...\n\nBut she may not need special ed. First off, if she doesn't talk at all at school she may be selectively mute. When kids are selectively mute, it's not necessarily that anyone did anything wrong (it can be caused by trauma, but it doesn't have to be), but psycotherapy can help. Next, for your discription of her behavior, it sounds like she probably has some form of a learning disability. I don't doubt that she's smart, but for whatever reason she doesn't process things in a 'normal' way. Get her tested! Be sure to find someone good to test her, even if it costs you more and/or you have to go farther from home, believe me it's worth it. A psycological assessment will tell you what's going on, and provide some recommendations about what to do about it (this is why you want a good tester - if the person testing her doesn't know much the report won't tell you much). In US public school, the results may also provide legal grounds to force the school to provide a suitable program (and I expect this is the case in public schools elsewhere, although I don't know for sure).
There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.

No, Bush did not deceive the American people. Please consider the following information as reference:\n\nIraqis can participate in three historic elections, pass the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and form a unity government despite terrorist attacks and provocations. Yet for some critics of the president, these are minor matters. Like swallows to Capistrano, they keep returning to the same allegations--the president misled the\ncountry in order to justify the Iraq war; his administration\npressured intelligence agencies to bias their judgments; Saddam Hussein turned out to be no threat since he didn't possess weapons of mass destruction; and helping democracy take root in the Middle East was a postwar rationalization. The problem with these charges is that they are false and can be shown to be so--and yet people continue to believe, and spread, them. Let me examine each in turn:\n\nThe president misled Americans to convince them to go to war. "There is no question [the Bush administration] misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq," according to Ted Kennedy. Jimmy Carter charged that on Iraq, "President Bush has not been honest with the\nAmerican people." And Al Gore has said that an "abuse of the truth" characterized the administration's "march to war." These charges are themselves misleading, which explains why no independent body has found them credible. Most of the world was operating from essentially\nthe same set of assumptions regarding Iraq's WMD capabilities. Important assumptions turned out wrong; but mistakenly relying on faulty intelligence is a world apart from lying about it.\n\nLet's review what we know. The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the intelligence community's authoritative written judgment on specific national-security issues. The 2002 NIE provided a key\njudgment: "Iraq has continued its [WMD] programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of U.N. restrictions; if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade."\n\nThanks to the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission, which\ninvestigated the causes of intelligence failures in the run-up to the war, we now know that the President's Daily Brief (PDB) and the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief "were, if anything, more alarmist and less nuanced than the NIE" (my emphasis). We also know that the intelligence in the PDB was not "markedly different" from that given to Congress. This helps explains why John Kerry, in voting to give\nthe president the authority to use force, said, "I believe\nthat a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security." It's why Sen. Kennedy said, "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." And it's why Hillary Clinton said in 2002, "In the four years since the inspectors, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild\nhis chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program."\n\nBeyond that, intelligence agencies from around the globe believed Saddam had WMD. Even foreign governments that opposed his removal from power believed Iraq had WMD: Just a few weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom, Wolfgang Ischinger, German ambassador to the U.S., said, "I think all of our governments believe that Iraq has produced\nweapons of mass destruction and that we have to assume that they continue to have weapons of mass destruction."\n\nIn addition, no serious person would justify a war based on\ninformation he knows to be false and which would be shown to be false within months after the war concluded. It is not as if the WMD stockpile question was one that wasn't g

Well in fact, well I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our marriage is saved\nWell this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne, pour the champagne\n\nI'd chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of closing\nthe god damn door?!"\nNo, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\nI'd chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door?!"\nNo, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\n\nAgain...\n\nI'd chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door?!"\nNo, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\nI'd chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door?!"\nNo, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\n\nAgain...
As thhe "air" in airplane implies, airplanes need air to fly. Their engines are designed to take in air, mix it with fuel and combust it to produce energy for propellers or jet engine thrust. Although many jetliners can operate at very high altitudes in thin air they can not operate within the near perfect vacuum of space with no air (oxygen) at all. Also, airplanes are propelled through air using wings (air foils) that give the airplane lift and control. There would be no lift or control within the vacuum of space.\n\nRockets and spacecraft on the other hand contain their own fuel and liquid oxygen (or other chemicals) that produce enormous thrust. They can not "fly" in air although some can glide to return to earth.

Think up a game that will result in something you've wanted to do but been afraid to ask for directly. Bets are great. For instance, I used to date a woman who had a bit of a submissive streak that I was unaware of. We made a bet that she could touch the bedroom doorknob and no holds barred. If I could stop her, I "owned" her until morning. Well, I won; and as it turns out, so did she... The wrestling match was hot and the results hotter!

Warmongers. I think to a certain extend it's okay- for example I find that studying past wars is fascinating. But people who seek to keep war alive are crazy. I believe there is a line. It is always okay to defend ourselves, our families, and our countries if we are attacked. I'm not so sure about going after people.

This is difficult, as there may be more than one formula for the compounds you listed.\n\nCopper (I) chloride is CuCl\nCopper (II) chloride is CuCl2\nLead nitride is usually used to mean "yellow lead" which is Lead (II) nitride, which is Pb3N2;\nbut it could also be used for Lead (IV) nitride which is Pb3N4.\n\nOne possible reaction:\nPb3N2 + 3 CuCl2 --> Cu3N2 + 3 PbCl2\n\nThis is a double replacement with no redox.
There isn't really an answer to this question. The town is never mentioned in the movie, only in the books it is mentioned that she lives near Butterfield. However, Butterfield does not exist. In some publicity material Baum had for his 1904-05 comic page, Dorothy writes a letter to her old friends and the address given is "Uncle Henry's Farm Near Topeka." In the book Return to Oz, Dorthy lives outside Franklin, which does exist. There is a tourist attraction in Liberal, Kansas that called Dorothy's house, which is a relocated farmhouse built in 1907, along with the original model of the house used in the film and a collection of memorabilia. Hope this helps, although there is no real answer
Might as well convert it all to yards. 3 feet in a yard, so your bedroom is 6 yards by 7 yards. To get square yards, you multiply length times width. So 6 x 7 = 42 square yards.

True democracy is worse than a dictatorship.\n\nA constitutional Republic with a good balance of power between branches of government.\n\nA multi party system would be preferred probably more like a Parliament where the people do not vote for the president only their Representative/senator.\n\nThe Constitution would severely limited the power of government and limit it's expansion as well as limit it's ability to tax, spend, and borrow when not in a declared emergency.

Internships would be a great asset to your school record, could connect you to people who can write those very important college recommendation letters and can give you some incite into where a career in physics could lead. Talk to your physics teacher and other science teachers. They could point you in the right direction. If you live close to a university or college, pop by their science department. Often you will see flyers for visiting speakers, public lectures and all sorts of events that could connect you with people that can give you guidance and advice.

Interesting question.\n\nSure there would have been far less wars, but then again both world wars had nothing to do with religion.\nThere wouldn't have been any witch burnings, but people would still have been hung, or tortured or killed for stealing to survive or for looking at a monarch the wrong way. \nSure you wouldn't have people knocking at your door hoping to shove the bible or whatever down your throats. Instead you'd probably get some scientist trying to verify his theory about where the world came from, and how we really are floating on the back of a giant turtle!\nThere would be less murder, but would there be less compassion?\nLess rasicsm? Not by much. \n\nThe annoying thing about religion is, we need it. There are those amognst us who don't, but the majority do. Without it people wouldn't live as long, wouldn't be as happy, life would have no purpose, no meaning, those who seek the easy answer would never find it. \n\nThe idea of God is a great one, and his main message is pretty good too. The only problem is all the other shit that gets mixed up with it, people are human, and humans are corrupt, therefore there will always be those who will use religion as a way of controling, or surpressing, or going to war. \n\nBut people have survived thanks to religion, if you ask the question would there be anarchy and sin ruling the world without religoin, my answer would be slightly different...But you didn't ask that, so...In answer to this question. No I don't think the world would be a better place without religion. But I don't think it would be choas. It would just be slightly worse.

Official answer: Earth! Why? Because it provides life, and some of it is amazingly beautiful.\n\nBut, if we were to go with planets other than earth, I'd say Jupiter and Saturn, because they're gorgeous. Jupiter has a stunning array of colors, and the thought that it's all one big violent storm just amazes me. Saturn, of course, has its phenomenal rings.\n\nOh! And if we're talking moons, then I'd say either Io (which is basically a huge mass of volcanoes; some of which are the size of Colorado!), and Europa, because beneath its icy surface may be an ocean which supports life.

SIMPLE = By using Other People's Money or OPM\n\nThis is a well known business strategy of those who may have great ideas but has no money. You simply find someone who will bankroll you and your ideas - whether it is real estate investing or small business investing. All you need is chutzpah, lots of glib and a super great plan that can convince anyone to plunk in their dollars.\n\nDaniel Ludwig, one of the wealthiest men of the 20th century and owned one of the largest US shipping companies, built his fortune by using OPM http://www.powerhomebiz.com/Success/ludwig.htm\n\nThe book "Rich Dad's Advisors: OPM (Other People's Money): How to Attract Other People's Money for Your Investments-the Ultimate Leverage" By Michael A. Lechter can teach you how to leverage OPM for your investments. You can read an excerpt of the book and learn about OPM from here http://www.powerhomebiz.com/books/richdadOPM.htm
Timeline of definition\n\n * 1790 May 8 — The French National Assembly decides that the length of the new metre would be equal to the length of a pendulum with a half-period of one second.\n\n * 1791 March 30 — The French National Assembly accepts the proposal by the French Academy of Sciences that the new definition for the metre be equal to one ten-millionth of the length of the Earth's meridian along a quadrant, that is the distance from the equator to the north pole.\n\n * 1795 — Provisional metre bar constructed of brass.\n\n * 1799 December 10 — The French National Assembly specifies that the platinum metre bar, constructed on 23 June 1799 and deposited in the National Archives, as the final standard.\n\n * 1889 September 28 — The first General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) defines the length as the distance between two lines on a standard bar of an alloy of platinum with ten percent iridium, measured at the melting point of water.\n\n * 1927 October 6 — The seventh CGPM adjusts the definition of the length to be the distance, at 0°C, between the axes of the two central lines marked on the prototype bar of platinum-iridium, this bar being subject to one standard atmosphere of pressure and supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571 millimetres from each other.\n\n * 1960 October 20 — The eleventh CGPM defines the length to be equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the 2p10 and 5d5 quantum levels of the krypton-86 atom.\n\n * 1983 October 21 — The seventeenth CGPM defines the length as equal to the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.

First, here’s the average measures:\nErect Length \nMODEST = 14 cm.(5.4")\nAVERAGE= 16 cm. (6.3")\nErect Circumference\nMODEST = 11,5 cm. (4.5")\nAVERAGE= 12,5 cm. (5.0")\nWhile sex even is possible with shorter penis.\nOn some (anonymous) web sites, you find miraculous pills, herbs or creams, which are of no effect.\nAs external methods, there is the pump and the Andro-penis.\nThe pump is practically useless because its effect doesn’t last long !\nThe Andro-penis by external device, with the time and sacrifice gives really a development and maybe a flabbier penis too, and since it’s a new method, nobody still know the possible collateral effects in the time. Somebody affirms that the same result could be possible with some constant and manual exercises. At last, there is the (risk) surgery operation, which isn’t suitable for anybody. \nSince I guess you’re not in the actual condition to resort to such technique, just enjoy your body as it’s. \nGood and satisfactory sex isn’t measured by penis length!

laying Lines:\nThe outside dimensions of the playing lines should be as follows:\nDoubles 36' x 78' (10.97m x 23.77m)\nSingles 27' x 78' (8.23m x 23.77m)\nAll lines should be not less than 1" (2.54 cm) nor more than 2" (5 cm) in width, except the base line which may be up to 4" (10 cm) in width and the center line which should be 2" (5 cm) in width.\nClearance Between Courts\nWhere courts are constructed within the confines of a common enclosure, the distance between side lines should be not less than 12' (3.658m). Where space permits, it is desirable to provide additional space between side lines to enhance play; 24' (7.315m) is recommended.\nTennis Court Orientation:\nA tennis court should be laid out to minimize players looking into the sun when serving or when following the flight of a ball. A tennis court also should be laid out to avoid distracting shadow lines and patterns on the court surface.\n\nTheoretically, the best possible layout would be to orient the longitudinal axis of the court perpendicular to the azimuth of the sun -- the angular measurement of the horizontal location of the sun in relation to true north. Since the azimuth of the sun constantly shifts according to the time of day, the season of the year and the latitude in which it is observed, it is difficult to generalize about an ideal orientation.\nNOTE: It is important to remember that the orientation of the court should be in relation to true north, not to magnetic north. The angular difference between true north and magnetic north is referred to as the "deviation of magnetic north." This deviation changes according to the geographic location. Information relating to the deviation of magnetic north from true north can be easily obtained from a local surveyor or airport facility.

20 years is too late? Girl are you wrong! I bet you think 30 is old. No it is never too late. But, do it for the right reasons. You can't do it for the money. The money is nice, but it is pale in comparison to the things you will have to do and learn to become a doctor. 20 years old is still a kid and you have no idea what the future holds for you. You probably still think getting drunk and attending parties is real fun. Well forget it if you go to MED school. You will have to do it on your own. Join a study group with fellow classmates. But, only you have the chance to get past Medical school. It is an achievement that only you can get.\n They will not give you the answers, you have to earn them. You will grow up during that time and learn about real people and real things.\n Remember, you can't do it for the money. If you do, you will not last long. You have to have the desire to help people with the real possibility of no thanks or reward.
you should do it where the business operates -- in the long run it's much easier.

Thermal cameras work in the infrared not in UV. There are cameras that can sense temperatures below -10 C. \n\nHowever, these are expensive and require special lens material. At such long wavelengths glass is no longer transparent. Materials like germanium (an opaque metal in visible light but transparent in far infrared) are used to make lenses. \n\nThe cameras also require cooling. You can imagine that a warm camera trying to see -10C would just see itself. The lens and the CCD array will glow and wipe out the image unless they are cooled to well below -10C.\n\nThe signal from the cold object is also very weak so the cameras electrical noise becomes a big issue requiring more sophisticated electronics.\n\nThese concerns make such cameras very expensive.

The reason for strict program formatting is consistency. Once you have a format that works, use it. If you use the same format (or structure) for all programs you write, you will be able to repeat past successes. If all programmers in your company use the same format for a given CNC machine, each programmer will be easily able to work on another's program.

Did you know he and your man Kerry went to the same school, and got virtually the same grades? Im glad you have your priorities in line for who leads the country.\n\n9. How so, show me please.\n\n10. So by taking a stand, he was just doing it for politics. If he did nothing, what would you say? You would say, "bush ignored 9/11" That one looks like a no win situation for Bush with the irrational libs.\n\n11. How so? Tell me please. He stands for hard work and freedom, isnt that the american way?\n\nMaking a long post with baseless allegations, and bragging about a phd does not impress most people who know how to think for themselves.
Hopefully, this isn't something that you've already tried and been frustrated with, but...\nReally, the Scheduled Tasks capability that is built into XP is great! If you've already tried it, then don't bother with this. But hopefully, this will work:\n\n- In Start, click Control Panel.\n- Now if your Control Panel is in Category View (you'll know it is if it has a blue bkground instead of white), then click 'Performance and Maintenance'. Otherwise, just ignore this part and keep going with the next step.\n- Click 'Scheduled Tasks'\n- Now, open the 'Add Scheduled Task' wizard that's at the top of the list.\n- 'Next' button\n- If your app. is on the list, just select it. Otherwise, 'Browse' for it.\n- Now whatever settings you need: Daily, Weekly, etc. Note: if you want biweekly or something similar, then choose 'weekly' right now.\n- Your exact schedule for the program.\n- Enter the password, if you have one. If you don't, then don't worry about it.\n- Check the box for advanced settings.\n- Now if you didn't have a password, then it will bring up an error. Just click 'OK' and we'll take care of it soon.\n- Now in the properties box, you'll have to check 'Run only if logged on', unless you have a password entered.\n- Take a look at the schedule, make sure it's right -- you have a lot more settings available here than in the wizard.\n- And now, for stopping the program. Under the 'Settings' tab, make sure to check the box 'Stop the task if it runs for...' and enter your time limit. Sorry, I don't know how to make it end at a time on the clock, but since it starts at a specific time, you can effectively make it do that by setting the time limit.\n\nDoes that work? I'd love to know.\n\nMuch easier than writing a program -- let's not reinvent the wheel. :)

The Bermuda Triangle is Bullsiht. To quote the Skeptic's Dictionary:\n\n"There are some skeptics who argue that the facts do not support the legend, that there is no mystery to be solved, and nothing that needs explaining.The number of wrecks in this area is not extraordinary, given its size, location and the amount of traffic it receives. Many of the ships and planes that have been identified as having disappeared mysteriously in the Bermuda Triangle were not in the Bermuda Triangle at all. Investigations to date have not produced scientific evidence of any unusual phenomena involved in the disappearances. Thus, any explanation, including so-called scientific ones in terms of methane gas being released from the ocean floor, magnetic disturbances, etc., are not needed. The real mystery is how the Bermuda Triangle became a mystery at all."

To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a "developing" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector.
I like the question. Some of the respondents seem rather hostile and unimaginitive, the kind of people who said the earth is flat, or "you will never go to the moon." \n\nNo human being knows what is at the core of the earth. Until you drill down through, you will never know. Yes, there is magma, but it could be a magma shell, not all the way through the core. The argument will never cease until it is done. \n\nWith current technology, we know of no way to build a tunnel through a molten rock environment. Or perhaps there is a way, but it is very expensive. So if someone has an idea on how to protect the tunnel with a forcefield or something weird, then it could be done. Maybe someday our technology will allow us to have better heat shielding. If the space shuttle can come blazing through space at over 25,000 miles per hour and land on earth without becoming a burnt marshmallow, there must be at least some ideas of how to insulate a tunnel bore.
I believe you have answered your own question quite well, especially with the wiki article. It has some off the worst aspects of both traditional liberalism and conservatism. It is pro - big government and pro - big spending, while it still insists on cutting revenue. It seems to think that it is OK to spend someone else's money, mainly the kids and grand-kids without properly preparing them to do so. Ultimately it will fail and be thoroughly discredited.

a) Not sure how you 'show' this... it's kind of trivial. Anything parallel to the x-axis is of the form y = constant, z = constant - and here the constants have to be b and c to go through the point, as there's no x dependence.\n\nb) |a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + a.b + |b|^2\nSo for it to balance, a.b = 0; that is, a and b are orthogonal.\n\nc) Let the vector be (x,y,z). Then:\n\n(1,1,0).(x,y,z) = 0 => x + y = 0\n(0,1,1).(x,y,z) = 0 => y + z = 0\n\nSo x = z = -y, and the vector is parallel to (1,-1,1). Normalising this to unit length gives:\n\n(1 / sqrt(3)) (1, -1, 1).

Red has the longest. Violet is the shortest.\n \nJust remember the ROYGBIV. Use the splitting of white light into rainbow colors method where light splits up as white light contains all the seven colors. In this experiment, the red light bends least in the prism while the voilet bends most as it travels slower.\n\nThe longer the wave length the faster it travels and the shorter the wavelength the the slower it travels. Because of this, we can deduce that red has the longer wavelength and violet has a longer wavelength.\n\nSorry, I am not in the right mind. Hope you understand...
Try stimulating yourself during intercourse. You will get yours and your man will be incredibly turned on from watching you. The best position for this is you lying on your back and him between your legs, kind of like missionary, but on his knees. If you aren't comfortable with him watching at first, do it doggy style and just reach back there (this is also a great way to stroke his scrotum, just the touch will drive him crazy.) Some women just can't orgasm without clitoral stimulation and there is nothing wrong with doing WHATEVER it takes to get yours!!

ok! well i used to have the same problem, MAJORLY! I read heaps about this. One thing i never knew is that eye liner actually contributes to this, because it carries chemicals that go into the pores to give this effect- so try not to wear it often and ALWAYS wash your face really well.\n\nNow theres this stuff... i totally cant remember what its called! Well like its something like moisture boost or something? and its meant for putting under your eyes! it works really well! \n\nbecause the skin under your eyes is half the thickness of the rest of the skin on your face, so it is prone to dryness and bags.\n\nDo a search and read up about it. All skin types are diffferent, and different methods will have different effects.
Some, yes. For example, a new vaccine is now promising to significantly reduce the cases of cervical cancer. It is estimated that as many as 2/3 of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). It follows, therefore, that reducing the incidence of infection from HPV will also reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Viruses as well as bacteria have been implicated in a number of other cancers. Heliobacter pylori (H Pylori) infections in the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to certain lymphomas of the gut. \n\nViruses sometimes work indirectly in causing cancers. For example, both AIDS and hepatitis are caused by viruses and they subsequently weaken the body and make it more susceptible to cancer. AIDS destroys the immune system and makes it harder for the body to ward off viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. Sadly, people suffering from AIDS are at a much higher risk for a multitude of cancers which the body would normally be able to protect itself from (including viruses like Epstein-Barr and certain herpesviruses that are themselves linked to cancer). Hepatitis increases the likelihood of liver cancer.\n\nHopefully, researchers will one day find an effective vaccine against viruses that are in one way or another linked to cancer.

For your sex and height, your ideal weight is 135 pounds but the ideal weight range is 127 pounds to 159 pounds. So you see you are just one pound over the range so you are hardly overweight.\nhttp://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/iwc\nYour weight does not just depend on exercise and diet. They are very important and other factors such as genetics, medical conditions, hormones and drugs come into play as well as your mental state. Some medical conditions are related to infertility such as hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome etc. I think you need to have a chat with your doctor if you want to do something about your weight although as I have shown above, you don't really have a weight problem yet.\n\nI agree with your mates that you look fine. Is your husband backing off because of your weight or because there are no kids? I think you need to have a good chat and thrash that out. He is supposed to stick by you through thick and thin and so far as you are not doing anything to wreck the marriage, he has no excuse for his behaviour.\n\nAlso remember that true beauty is not just your looks. People will be attracted to you because of your character, how warm you are, how friendly you are etc.\n\nLastly, don't let anyone put you down.

Fibromyalgia is a "syndrome", not a disease. It is compromised of several co-conditions, one being that it is a neurotransmitter disorder. Here are the results of a test done on Fibromyalgia patients which proves that there is a problem.\n\nFibromyalgia pain, isn't all in patients' heads new brain study finds. \nJune 7, 2002 \nfMRI scans give first objective measure of mysterious ailment, provide road map for future study\n\nANN ARBOR, MI - A new brain-scan study confirms scientifically what fibromyalgia patients have been telling a skeptical medical community for years: They're really in pain.\n\nIn fact, the study finds, people with fibromyalgia say they feel severe pain, and have measurable pain signals in their brains, from a gentle finger squeeze that barely feels unpleasant to people without the disease. The squeeze's force must be doubled to cause healthy people to feel the same level of pain - and their pain signals show up in different brain areas.\n\nThe results, published in the May issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, the journal of the American College of Rheumatology, may offer the proof of fibromyalgia's physical roots that many doubtful physicians have sought. It may also open doors for further research on the still-unknown causes of the disease, which affects more than 2 percent of Americans, mainly women.\n\nLead authors Richard Gracely, Ph.D., and Daniel Clauw, M.D., did the study at Georgetown University Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health, but are now continuing the work at the University of Michigan Health System. In an editorial in the same issue, Clauw and U-M rheumatologist Leslie Crofford, M.D., stress the importance of fibromyalgia research and care.\n\nTo correlate subjective pain sensation with objective views of brain signals, the researchers used a super-fast form of MRI brain imaging, called functional MRI or fMRI, on 16 fibromyalgia patients and 16 people without the disease. As a result, they say, the study offers the first objective method for corroborating what fibromyalgia patients report they feel, and what's going on in their brains at the precise moment they feel it. And, it gives researchers a road map of the areas of the brain that are most - and least - active when patients feel pain.\n\n"The fMRI technology gave us a unique opportunity to look at the neurobiology underlying tenderness, which is a hallmark of fibromyalgia," says Clauw. "These results, combined with other work done by our group and others, have convinced us that some pathologic process is making these patients more sensitive. For some reason, still unknown, there's a neurobiological amplification of their pain signals."\n\nFurther results from the study were presented last year at the ACR annual meeting. The project will continue later this year at UMHS, joining other fMRI fibromyalgia research now under way.\n\nFor decades, patients and physicians have built a case that fibromyalgia is a specific, diagnosable chronic disease, characterized by tenderness and stiffness all over the body as well as fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal problems and depression. Many patients with the disease find it interferes with their work, family and personal life. Statistics show that far more women than men are affected, and that it occurs mostly during the childbearing years.\n\nThe ACR released classification criteria for fibromyalgia in 1990, to help doctors diagnose it and rule out other chronic pain conditions. Clauw and Crofford's editorial looks at the current state of research, and calls for rheumatologists to take the lead in fibromyalgia care and science.\n\nBut many skeptics have debated the very existence of fibromyalgia as a clearly distinct disorder, saying it seemed to be rooted more in psychological and social factors than in physical, biological causes. Their argument has been bolstered by the failure of research to find a clear cause, an effe

The decor is Moroccan to the last detail: deep-red rugs, coloured-glass chandeliers, low-slung leather stools and banquettes piled high with cushions. A young, worldly crowd lounges around drinking thé à la menthe - served as it should be with pine nuts bobbing on top. Friendly service and a lethal selection of cocktails make a perfect spot for leisurely drinking. Attractive Franco-Moroccan menu, too.\n\nLe Fumoir\n6 rue de l’Amiral-de-Coligny, 1st (01.42.92.00.24). M° Louvre Rivoli. \nOpen 11am-2am daily.

A sleek crowd sipping Martinis or browsing the papers at the long mahogany bar (originally from a Chicago speakeasy) gives way to young professionals in the restaurant and pretty young things in the library. It can feel a little try-hard and well-behaved, but some expertly mixed cocktails and a little friendly flirting with the PRs on the prowl are guaranteed to take the edge off the evening. \n\nHemingway Bar at the Ritz\nThe Ritz, 15 pl Vend? 1st (01.33.43.16.30.30).

Closed 3wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, DC, MC, V. \n\nThis much lauded bar has become a cocktailers’ cliché, but that’s because it’s simply one of the loveliest places in Paris to do drinkies. The dark wood, muffled laughter, black-and-white photos of Papa H and the old-school charm of Colin the head barman and lovely Ludo his second, make the bar a cocoon from the horrors of the outside world. Leather seating and five-star service (a glass of berry-scented water appears within 30 seconds of arrival) preface cocktails are as near to alcoholic nirvana as possible - not least the divine raspberry Martini. Pulling in its fair share of characters, honeymooners and expense-account nerds, it’s also a wonderful place to see what the human race does in its spare time. Opened across the corridor is the Cambon Bar: the original Ritz bar, done up as it was back in its ’20s heyday.\n\nKong\n1 rue du Pont-Neuf, 1st (01.40.39.09.00). M° Pont Neuf. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Sat. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nPhilippe Starck’s latest addition to the Paris scene is, predictably, one of the city’s hottest places to do cocktails, ideally located on the top two floors of the Kenzo building overlooking the Pont Neuf. The bright mishmash interior is manga-inspired with lots of neon, Hello Kitty knick-knacks, comfy grey leather sofas and rocking chairs at the main dining tables, best avoided after a few too many coupes. The best bet is to perch at the long bar, flirt with the too-beautiful-to-bartend staff and order an excellent vodkatini or three. After dark you can make a music suggestion with each order - at weekends they somehow carve out a tiny dancing space for the trendy crowd to strut their stuff on.

It first appeared in Pierre Gripari’s two-part short-story collection Contes de la rue Broca, but it has come a long way since those dingy days. Nowadays it’s the chouchou of students and thirtysomething couples, especially at concert time when live chords get feet tapping.

First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nWhat is a Soul?\nRight in the very first book of the Bible, Genesis, we are told that the soul is not something you have, it is something you are. We read of the creation of Adam, the first human being: “The man came to be a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) The Hebrew word used here for soul, ne'phesh, occurs well over 700 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, never once conveying the idea of a separate, ethereal, spiritual part of man. On the contrary, the soul is tangible, concrete, physical.\n\nLook up the following cited texts in your own copy of the Bible, for the Hebrew word ne'phesh is found in each of them. They clearly show that the soul can face risk, danger, and even be kidnapped (Deuteronomy 24:7; Judges 9:17; 1 Samuel 19:11); touch things (Job 6:7); be locked up in irons (Psalm 105:18); crave to eat, be afflicted by fasting, and faint from hunger and thirst; and suffer from a wasting disease or even insomnia as a result of grief. (Deuteronomy 12:20; Psalm 35:13; 69:10;) In other words, because your soul is you, your very self, your soul can experience anything you can experience.\n\nDoes that mean, then, that the soul can actually die? Yes. Far from being immortal, human souls are spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures as being “cut off,” or executed, for wrongdoing, being struck fatally, murdered, destroyed, and torn to pieces. (Exodus 31:14; Deuteronomy 19:6; 22:26; Psalm 7:2) “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die,” says Ezekiel 18:4. Clearly, death is the common end of human souls, since all of us sin. (Psalm 51:5) The first man, Adam, was told that the penalty for sin was death—not transfer to the spirit realm and immortality. (Genesis 2:17) And when he sinned, the sentence was pronounced: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) When Adam and Eve died, they simply became what the Bible often refers to as ‘dead souls’ or ‘deceased souls.’\n\nSome people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ?\n\nBible writers used the Hebrew word ru´ach or the Greek word pneu´ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [God] take away their spirit [ru´ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu´ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru´ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah’s day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru´ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures.

I had the same problem when I was first put on it...the first two weeks were hell. My therapist said it can take up to 6 weeks for it to regulate in your body. I had a complete loss of sex drive, and I would completely "space out" at work. It was awful, but it eventually went away!\n\nKeep your head up!

Yahoo seems to be nutral in everything. What is writen here is done by people that have nothing to do with yahoo, but the survices they provide and the advertizing on those pages is nutral.

Aliens are not going to arrive, so there is no worry about them proving anything. The "Anthropic Principle" proves that the universe is fine-turned for intelligent life to be on earth and no where else in the universe. We know for sure there is no intelligent life as far out as 230 light-years. From 230 light-years away, it would take a spacecraft traveling at 7 million miles per hour, 23,000 years to get here, if it were able to miss all the space junk and the fuel and craft and beings didn't expire.

An exclamation mark is not a valid character for an e-mail address extension (or web address) so it wouldn't be possible to add it - that's just how it is, just like it's not possible for me to upload a picture into this answer - someone created the protocols and we're bound by them.\n\nYou can have (!) in the first part of an e-mail address but not in the part that comes after the dot - xyz!!!@yahoo.com is acceptable but xyz@yahoo.com! isn't.\n\nI'm guessing that somewhere along the line someone has mistyped your e-mail address or has perhaps copied and pasted it but inadvertently included an exclamation mark.\n\nMany people on seeing xyz@yahoo.ca! would realize it should be xyz@yahoo.ca and correct the error themselves but I'd suggest you e-mail those people who you suspect may have your e-mail address incorrectly and advise them of the error.\n\nJust to clarify, this service is something provided by Yahoo which is available for anyone to ask and answer questions on. It's not a facility for contacting Yahoo themselves - just clarifying in case you had hoped to get a response from Yahoo staff.

I think that would be a good idea. American citizens need to show a counter opinion to the recent protests of the illegal immigrants. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease! If legal American citizens do not voice their opinions, government will believe that the majority of Americans are okay with illegal immigration in the USA.

There are different opinions on this question. Perhaps the most obvious is that the Scottish Parliament has control over Health Expenditure and is prepared to devote more money that it's equivalent in England. As to why this is, is a matter of opinion. Some people may argue that Scotland health departmant is more efficient. Other people may say the "Barnett Formula" introduced in 1978 provides more money for Scotland than England and Wales. It could, of course be argued that if Scotland was allowed to keep all the money from oil revenue, than there would be even more money available for heath expenditure, but this is not an argument I am prepared to debate on these pages!

Kids start school at 6, and have cheap/virtually free childcare before that, if required. Also after school care, in school, with qualified teachers. They finish lower secondary at 15(ish) after 9th grade, and most continue to upper secondary (gymnasium) for 3 more years. All schools are free, including tertiary education. Healthcare is virtually free (you pay a small fee per GP visit.) and yes, nationalised. Dental care is free until you are 18. \n\nAs for family values, well, we love our kids. I fear you would be disappointed with swedish attitudes to marriage etc, however, most people here simply don't bother getting married, and are perfectly happy that way (I recall one wee girl at preschool being surprised to find out you _could_ get married before you have children). That doesn't mean families aren't important, they are, very much so, but I rather the Swedish idea of what a family is tends not to revolve around a religious (or even civil) ceremony.\n\nYes there are people who work 40 hour weeks and have trouble making ends meet, but that's true anywhere. Not everyone is in a position to get a good paying job, either through lack of skill, or unwillingness to move. Most people are doing "ok", and real poverty is pretty uncommon.\n\nFrom a New Zealander's perspective, Sweden is like NZ in another language. It's really not much like Britain, culturally or politically (and yes, I have lived in the UK too). \n\nAnd the light treatment stuff is probably overdone in the foreign press. As are the alcohol taxes :) Also, the pop music is better here.

You cannot patent or copyright a name, you trademark a name. A "trademark" is a word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others.\n\nEvery state issues their own trademarks, but getting a state trademark is virtually useless. The federal registration will for all intents and purposes trump any state registration. For example, if you get a trademark in Florida and use the mark in commerce only in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently another party files for a federal registration on the same mark, you are estopped from using your mark outside of Orlando! Moreover, a state registration does not even entitle you to rights throughout the entire state. Notice in the previous example that I said that if someone were to obtain a federal registration on the same mark for which you had a Florida state registration you would only be able to use the mark in your geographic area, not throughout the state. So if you use the mark in commerce in Orlando, Florida, and someone acquires a federal registration, they can use the mark in Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, etc. The important concept here is that while a state registration is usually much cheaper than a federal registration, state registration provides little or no significant rights.\n\nFinally, in terms of copyright protection for an insurance product, that is likely not the best form of protection. A copyright only protects expression, not function. Patents, on the other hand, protect function. If your insurance product is new and non-obvious you could receive a patent on it, likely a business method patent. It is wise to seek copyright protection though, because it is so cheap.\n\nIn terms of how long it will take to obtain a patent or trademark, US patents for business methods could easily take 3 to 4 years from the date you file an application. Trademarks, however, are much quicker. Normally you would expect the whole process of obtaining a federal trademark in the US to take about 14 months.

It is a way of using x-rays to see the structure of a crystal:\n\nCrystals are three dimensional ordered structures than can be described as a repetition of identical unit cells. The unit cell is made up of the smallest possible volume that when repeated, is representative of the entire crystal. \n\nUsing visible light, it will never be possible to see atoms under even the most powerful of microscopes. In order for an object to be seen, its size needs to be at least half the wavelength of the light being used to see it. Since visible light has a wavelength much longer that the distance between atoms it is useless to see molecules. In order to see molecules it is necessary to use a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength on the order of bond lengths, such as X-rays.

The mirena coil and ovarian cyst could be related. One of the side effects of the mirena coil is endometriosis. Also, however, ovarian cysts can come and go, and possibly (even though 40 is a bit young) you could be in para-menopausal and sometimes ovarian cysts can develop yet dissolve on their own. Also, at 40 your metabolism will begin to slow down, so it's best to watch your calorie intake and keep up daily exercise to avoid weight gain. At 40 your body begins not to want to metabolize all the sweets and fats that it handled when you were younger. As for the Prozac; how long have you been on it? Even though Prozac, when you first start taking it, causes a decrease in appetite, after you have been on it for possibly a couple of years, a side effect can be just the opposite. All in all, 40 is a great age. Enjoy this next decade. It could be the best time of your life.

A fluorescent tube has filaments at each end that have to heat up to vaporize the mercury necessary to start the tube. Since they start so fast, the starting doesn't really cost that much more in electricity usage.\n\nHowever, the ballast on the twin 40 watt tube fixture uses about 20 watts by itself. Thus, two 40 watt bulbs require 100 watts to operate.\n\nOnce the tube has started, the filaments are no longer activated and no longer consume power. Since they burn hot, turning the bulb on and off will shorted the life of the tube.

Capacitor, device for storing an electrical charge, sometimes called a condenser. In its simplest form a capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a non-conducting layer called the dielectric. The dielectric may be air, plastic, waxed paper, or another substance such as the mineral mica. When one plate of a capacitor is charged using a battery or other source of direct current, the other plate becomes charged with the opposite sign; that is, positive if the original charge is negative, and negative if the original charge is positive\nThe electrical size of a capacitor is its capacitance, that is the amount of electric charge it can hold per unit potential difference across its plates—C = Q/V. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F). Because this is such a large unit, capacitors commonly have their size expressed in µF (1 microfarad = 10-6 F) or pF (1 picofarad = 10-9 F).
At the treble clef, take the last sharp on the right, call it "7" and count down the spaces and lines until you get to "1". "1" is "Do."

That's "Do."\n\nAs for minors and majors . . . sheesh, take a music class or something.

wow those are 2 completely different musical genres. Ska, in it's purist form, is from Jamaica in the '60s. It did gain popularity in the 80's with the two-tone movement, a form of mixing Ska with punk, new wave, rock, and stuff. New wave was the post punk sound that was a cleaned up version of that music. They're not directly connected, but they were mixed.

If you mean "treat" as in pay for dinner or something - as opposed to giving your kid or dog a treat :) - this is the best way I've ever seen:\n\nCourtesy of a friend of mine, I have learned that the easiest way to treat for dinner & not get an arguement of discussion (in most cases) is to inform the server at the beginning of the meal, when ordering. It can be done quietly & with no fanfare - my friend tends to make as if asking a question about the menu & telling the waitstaff at that time - or you can simply precede your order with, "And I'll be paying tonight." Another approach is to inform the waitstaff who shows you to your table or to excuse yourself for the restroom & tell the server while you are away. In most of these situations it is an easy thing to do even if other people are around.\n\nAnother thing my friend does is that he will normally jump in to order first when he's decided that he's treating us. It can be quite funny to watch he & my husband if they've both decided to treat on the same night. One server brought the house down one evening when, as they were beginning to discuss the pay issue, she said; "Why don't you just split the bill & be done with it?"
Any marriage can work if both of you want it to. Just remember each of you might almost give up and the other person is going to have to help that person along.\n\nYou need to figure out how you would live your lives with separate religions, set clear boundaries and respect each other. HOw will you decorate your home? Simple things like that can cause huge arguments in the future.\n\nDO you have friends & family that are supportive, because you will need them when ones who aren't supportive want to push you two away from each other.\n\nAnd finally, after making sure you both have the same goals and desires for life, discuss what you would do if you had a child together. How would they be raised, what religion if any, etc...\n\nJust remember marriage is a committment not to be taken lightly, really look at your future and what you are capable of, look at the reality not the potential (although keep potential in mind)\nand TAKE YOUR TIME! don't rush into marriage!\n\nGood Luck!
Strengths - they know a lot about an organization, are generally people persons, organized\n\nWeaknesses - are stereotyped to their position - i.e. all they do is type letters, file, do memos, make coffee, run personal errands for their bosses,etc. \n\nThe secretarial field is becoming more specialized and secretaries, while still do the memos and all that stuff, do a lot more. They are essential to an organization and can make or break their boss.
I hope they blow them selves up !
It is only normal to worry about someone you've been with that long and that you have kids with. However, this marriage is over, and it is not your job to save him. The best thing you can probably do for him is to let someone in his family know what is going on and let them try and help him out. You have enough on your plate trying to do what is best for your kids and for yourself. You will still need to be sensitive and aware to some degree what is going on in his life for your kids sake but you need to accept that you are not responsible for what he does, he is.

UFOs are real I have seen them all of my life..I have never seen an alien...but..there is no doubt in my mind they are incontrol of the objects..My last sighting was 3 weeks ago..they are here..for some reason..Maybe eveyone should pay attention..We certainly are NOT alone nor are we intelligent..It is proven daily how primitive we truly are.

HI,\nNo, no easy way to change it. Your IP address is set by the Internet Service Provider you use. You can change your ISP, but it would also change your email (like Outlook Express, Outlook, etc) addresses.\nAnother way is to use Google, and do a search for "jap", without quotes. This is a free program that will use another server, after your ISP server, changing your IP address automatically. I use dial-up, and it's just too slow.\nIf you have cable, you might check it out.\nBest of luck, and please rate my answer.

These can consist of the information stored in the genetic code, but also experimental results from various sources, patient statistics, and scientific literature. Research in bioinformatics includes method development for storage, retrieval, and analysis of the data. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing branch of biology and is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and linguistics. It has many practical applications in different areas of biology and medicine.\n\nVR
I would like a detailed knowledge of Gerontology(The study of ageing). This interests me, because it`s a process that happens to us all-if we are fortunate.\nI think, in some societies, older people (65plus)are often marginalised and not valued as much as they should be.\nSomeone once described the Older Generation as \n"our future selves" and that truism is for me, the bottom line.

Two strategies: 1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\n\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live. Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc). Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone? Cancel one. Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!) Eat in. Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\n\n2) list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest. Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off. \n\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line). Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards). "You could lose your house", yes, if you are stupid or not careful. But you can also eliminate debt much quicker! \n\nShop every rate that you have. If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it. You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\n\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings. Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line). High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me.

I think the leaders of most nations cater to big business and organizations that don't always have the peoples interest in mind. These companies put large amounts of money into their local/national politicians and usually have economic implications that affect all classes. Our precious planet ultimately suffers as well.

I think that the administration at your son's school should want take bullying much more seriusly. With all of the school shootings in the last couple of years, I don't know why they would want something like this to go unresolved. I would remind the administration of what happened at Columbine. If they don't want the same thing to happen at their school and it easily could, no school is safe! You may want to share with them the play "Bang Bang You're Dead." It is a play dedicated to ending school violence. Your son's school needs to get its students active AGAINST school violence. There should be zero tolerance for it!! Having the students put on this play could be a start to the education process. Also seek out other parents to go to the administration and take a stand. Contact the Parent Teacher Organization and educate them. They are not going to want to have their child potentially put in danger.

You cannot have a healthy, happy relationship with anyone else until you have one with yourself. Get help. Stop thinking happiness lies outside yourself. It does not. Be love and you will attract love. Focus on developing body, mind, and spirit. As desperate as you are, the only partner(s) you will attract will bring unhappiness. Take the focus off yourself. Get together with other folks your age and do a full range of activities like sports, dance, hiking, prayer, volunteering. Enjoy every day the way things are and guaranteed you will attract wonderful friends and, at just the right time,the love of your life.
Try a chiropractor. Also try to eat a more alkaline than acid diet: less protein and cooked foods, more raw fruits and vegetables.\n\nDry skin brushing will help with all-over circulation: http://healingtools.tripod.com/skinbrush.html Be sure to use a different brush for your neck and face than for the rest of your body. And make sure it's a natural bristle brush, not one of those plastic things.\n\nNiacin helps to bring blood to the surface of the skin. You may need to eat more foods high in niacin: foods high in protein, like meat, eggs, and peanuts. B supplements need to be taken in balance. If you can find an herbalist in your area, they can help you find a combination B suited to your needs.\n\nI hope this helps! I can't imagine how stressful that must be.

I doubt it but you could be the first to offer him an olive branch. Just because your relatives can't seem to get along doesn't mean the both of you can't. However, be prepared for the eventuality that he may not want to resume ties with you. There is a reason why the past is past. But you can try. Usually though, they don't like hearing about your present love interests. If you haven't been in touch in a couple of years, that means he's moved on and so should you. Why don't you just get perspective on your love life now with your other girl-friends instead of your ex?
Well, we look at it and consider it a lot. Fortunately, there are still girls willing to look away from a guy's financial difficulties. Take note, this happens when a girl is already decided that she loves the guy. Just try to take it slow before confronting the long term issue. That way, she would have seen a lot of good character from you and it would be easier to put the money thing aside. Show her that you can compensate for that with something else :)

I've been in the clinic for 3 1/2 years and I've been detoxing for a while now. Don't do it to fast it can be really dangerous. Try going down the way I am, I drop down 2 mgs every other day for three weeks, then I take a break for two weeks. That way its not such a shock to your body. This has worked great for me and I've had 14 friends get off methadone and stay off this way. You could also call a doctor or a drug help line(you don't have to tell them your name). I don't know if they could help but it would be worth a try. Good Luck!!! If all else fails maybe you could try the program. But I would try on my own first if I were you, just be careful. If you start to feel bad you can always go back up for a few days.
The ballots for 2007 aren't made yet. However, if you're talking about this year you should be able to just go online to your local office of elections site and find one online. Often the newspapers will have links to it as well.
Talk to your doctor.\n\nFirst, s/he will give you this information, and a whole lot more information that you need if you're trying to get pregnant, including dietary information that can improve your chances of conceiving and carrying a child without much inconvenience.\n\nSecond, these days there are lots of genetic tests that can be performed to ensure that your boyfriend and you are genetically compatible -- that is, unlikely to produce a child with a genetic disease. For some ethnicities this is a crucial step, but it's really something that everyone should do, BEFORE you get pregnant.
I am a luminous being, beautiful in my own fragility. I am a sculpture, a singer, a painter, an artist. I am the girl who wakes up in the morning and looks in the mirror and says: Good morning. You don't look so good right now, but God sees beyond this half-asleep glob and sees a beautiful soul. I am who I am. That is all I need, and that is all I know.
The Looks isn't always supposed tobe the fact that makes a person loveable. It's simply a materialistic value or a first impression. You may understand that certain feelings, like understanding each other, has tobe more advanced with time. That's true love! \n\nIf he rejected you for your looks this means, he didn't simply love you, but he had lust on you. Its much different. Ask him, whether he had any misunderstandings lately. Anyone, anything said or happenned wrong? It could be a very simple thing. Try to mend the thing, or get ready to dump him. Its always upto you. Things always have a "Wind-of-Change" if it wasn't for good.\nBye,
This is not exactly an answer, but have yuou considered asking yourself or anyone else, why we have military bases in Nigeria? Why?? Because Nigeria has something we want. If there is something to gain, we support those who help us get it. \n\nThink about it. I don't know where you live. But in the United States, Nigeria was an unspoken word until the latter part of last year. No one cared about Nigeria. I did when I found that Clintom and George Bush were getting serums together for HIV victims. That was the "clue".
Wrong! The people outside the bus will see the bullet falling, assuming the bus is long enough to allow someone to notice such an event. But theoretically you are correct.\n\nLet me ask you a question: What makes you think of such things?
"Bad" is relative and subjective; different for every person; a perception.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act is the tail that wags the dog, and is unconstitutional. The Federal Reserve is a private institution, run by a few very powerful men, that decide the fate of our economy.\n\nIs that bad? I would say so. Not what our forefathers intended. You're complaining about nickels and dimes. The whole thing is a scam.

If it has been sitting in the hot storage compartment of your motor home in summer and you get it out and accidentally drop it on the ground, it explodes.

At least that is what happened to me.

variable interest rate: A variable interest rate is based on fluctuating rates in the banking system, such as the prime rate. For example, if on January 1, the prime rate was 6 percent and your credit card's variable rate formula was the prime rate plus 9.9 percent, your interest rate would be 15.9 percent (see prime rate).\n\nprime rate: The interest rate banks charge for loans to their biggest and highest-rated customers. The prime rate changes based on the demand for money and the rate the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank charges to its member banks. It is used as a major economic indicator.

Registered Nurse here; First let me clear up the myth, (untruth about mononucleosis), it does not stay with you for life. The incubation period is about 7 to 21 days, give or take 3 or 4 days in either direction. Someone that had mono 6 years ago, is in no way, shape, form or fashion caring it today, unless they have been re-exposed to the viral infection.
Let me begin by saying a degree is mandatory , to be specific a technical degree.It doesn't mean people with a commerce background will not get in.But it does happen that now since India churns out millions of engineers, its a little difficult for commerce graduates. \nIndia is now increasing dominant in the IT services sector which calls for excellent communication skills both verbal and written. \nNowadays a first class degree is a norm and it is difficult if you have a second class or below. \nNext is getting into a IT company. I really don't stress on getting into biggies and a small company would be excellent to start with because you end up learning a lot of things. usually companies have an aptitude test and once you clear it they have different rounds like personal round or an HR round where they test your behavioural skills and how you react to different situations. \nThere is no limit to knowledge and you can attain loads of skills. To begin with Internet programming is what I suggest. There is a wonderful site called www.w3schools.com which teaches basic programming.\nYou can begin with HTML and then slowly move on to ASP and SQl Server and then dot net.Once you get going there is nothing stopping you. Mind you....this site just gets you started and then once you finish off with the basics there are loads of sites which help you.

Part 1\nThe tangent at a point (a, b) to the hyperbola\n\nx²/16 - y²/4 = 1\n\nhas the equation \n\nax/16 - by/4 = 1 \n\n(similarly for other 2 deg curves). You can see why this is a straight line passing thru (a, b). It's less obvious that this is the tangent line (to show this, work out the gradient vectors of x²/16 - y²/4 and of ax/16 - by/4 at (a, b); they are the same up to scale, which means that the hyperbola and the straight line are perpendicular to the same vector, and therefore are tangent to each other).\n\nAt the point a = 5 and b = -3/2, the line's slope is a/4b = -5/6.\n\n\nIn Part 2, the "0" must mean the angle theta. \nIn polar coordinates, \n\nx = r cos(theta)\ny = r sin(theta)\n\nSo the equation y = 3x + 5 becomes \n\nr sin(theta) = 3r cos(theta) + 5\n\nor \n\nr = 5/[sin(theta) - 3cos(theta)]\n\n(which is C).\n\nYou can also use trig identities to rewrite this in the form r = D/cos(theta - a constant), which is the std form of the polar equation of a straight line (see, for example, http://www.xtec.es/~rgonzal1/treatise.pdf, page 41).

A true democracy never has existed and never will. A true democracy implies that everyone has a vote on everything. Now when teacher says that ancient Greece was a democracy that isn't the truth, because women, children, slaves, and convicts were prohibited from voting.

Mexican Lily,\nNo, ephedra products aren't gone anymore - the FDA lifted the ban!\n\nMy wife tried a product called Herbalean with 10mg of Ma Huang epehdra (max allowed by the FDA) and hoodia, and she liked it so much she became a distributor.\n\nHerbalean is made by the same company the originally made MetaboLife 356, but their new formula won't give you the jitters.

As other have said, plasma in dried form is a straw or amber colour.\n\nIt does NOT exist as flakes. The proteins and salts in plasma ensure that it dries as a crystalline solid.

Something that my lover gave me once (after a hard days work) and it totally blew my mind. She invited me in, peeled my dirty clothes off, walked me to her bathroom and helped me slip into the candle lit bubble bath she had made for me.\n\nShe then brought me a beer, then minutes later came into the room naked, carrying a plate with an incredible steak meal she had just made for me. She sat near the bath-tub, cut my meal for me and fed me a fork-full at a time. She was a model from New York, and between her beauty, her style, her grace and her generosity she burned that moment in to my mind, and it will be there forever. \n\nThink about it, candle lit bubble bath, a cold beer, a beautiful woman and a great meal. It wasn't dying and going to heaven, but darn close! --tim--
Realizing too late in my freshman year in college what a hick I actually was. It was something a little condescending and patronizing someone said about a stupid, tacky plaque hanging on my wall. It wasn't that it turned me into a snob all at once at that moment - on the contrary, it made me really self-conscious. I think I realized how narrow my experience had been. Oddly, it made me more curious and more willing to expand my mind & broaden my taste. It helped me learn to be the guy - for better or worse - I've become.

A few simple things will go a long way. Stay active all summer so you get in great shape. Work on staying low when you start and getting up to speed very quickly. You can do jumping drills to help get more explosive. Also work on your sprinting form, learn about proper form and train with a friend so you help each other out. Better form and a better start mean a lot for the 40.\n\nRunning a 40, resting 20 seconds then running another, resting 20 and running another, then taking a few minutes rest is also a drill that some of the college kids use before the NFL combine.

Wow, 150% of her pens are red. You should note that Claire has more red pens than total pens, which makes no sense at all.

It depends on what type of woman you are. You could be a screamer or a moaner. But to tell the truth be yourself and be physical.

If you are stuck without a "weapon", try to "punch" the shark in the nose, and try to poke his eyes out. \n\nTo prevent an attack: Don't wear shiny or "flashy" watches or jewelry. Sharks are attracted to "blood" so don't have any major cuts or bleeding from wounds ,(or otherwise). They are slightly sensitive to the color "red", so don't wear all red shorts or wet-suit's. If you spearfish, don't carry your catch on your waist.\n\nAnd if you are on a sinking vessel, in the rigging/mast, and you only have 1 shot at shooting and hitting a scuba tank, wedged into the mouth of a charging white shark, say a prayer to Rory Sheider and make sure you HIT that TANK! lol

YES.\n\nThough it depends on what you mean by "moving"\n\nIf you mean getting from one place to another as fast or faster than light, it is possible though not currently provable.\n\nThere are a few "workarounds" for the light speed barrier. My personal favorite was cooked up by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. It is called the Alcubierre Metric, or sometimes the Alcubierre Drive.\n\nIt relies on stretching space time in a wave that would carry a potential vessel faster than light, relative to an outside observer. It works because relative to the space within the wave, the vessel isn't moving at all. It also avoids the other problems with light speed travel, time dilation and such.\n\nThe problem is no one knows how to build one, but mankind has overcome every obstacle in its way thus far, I think the light speed barrier will be the same.\n\nThose saying something is impossible are usually interrupted by other people doing it.\n\nMore on the Alcubierre Metric here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\n- Cai

A little discipline?? \n\nWe always put ours in time out. We also don't mind a good old fashioned spanking either. We take our 5 year olds nintendo and put it in time out when he is being unreasonable. This seems to make him really upset. Whichever method you use, be consistent. I find that my two walk all over me when I start making threats and not following through. So they get me back on track every now and again.\n\nSomething we do for good behavior is a "Star Jar"\nWhen they do something good they get a ball in their jar. But, if they do something bad they have to take the ball out (they hate this). When the jar is full, I take them to the dollar store and let them purchase something for a dollar.

None. I, too, am an Independent. I refuse to pigeon-hole myself to fall into one group or the other when both are filled with lying crooks. I tend to lean on the liberal side socially and the conservative (not neo-con) side fiscally. \n\nI am for any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. This includes the "all men are created equal" part. Gay rights, women's rights, minority rights, the right to bear arms, freedom of speech and religion - all of these were directly or indirectly mentioned in these documents, which form the basis of our society. \n\nI am for the death penalty if it is used fairly and is non-discriminatory.\n\nI am for welfare if it is a temporary assistance program and not a lifelong handout. \n\nI am for a balanced budget. Every American needs to balance their budget, why can't America?\n\nI am against foreign intervention and foreign aid, except where our national security is at risk, or for humanitarian purposes. I am opposed to torture and “extraordinary rendition”, because it lowers us to the level of terrorists. I am opposed to the US denial of Geneva Convention rights to Prisoners-of-War. \n\nI did not vote for Bush, and would not vote for McCain, either. I used to like McCain before he started "stumping" for the man who insulted him, calling him a "senator-for-sale" and saying he abandoned fellow veterans. I lost all respect for him after that. I have said I might vote for Murtha or Kucinich, but, truthfully, I have yet to see a candidate who is worthy of the job.

You have to make it clear to her that it is because of her psychotic behavior that you're breaking up with her.

I have found that Sara Lee Multi Grain wheat bread is the most healthy all around. You get a big slice for only about 100 calories & it is 100% whole grain. The 100% whole grain is the most important thing when buying bread because it is loaded with healthy fiber to keep your digestive tract healthy among many other things. Brands that state "made with whole grains" are NOT the same as 100% whole grains.
That is tricky. It would depend on your location and how you are used to living. I support my family of 3, a dog and a cat on $1500 a month. That doesn't leave a lot of room for extras, but we do go out once in a while. We have everything that we want, but we must budget for large purchases.

A problem is assigned to the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) class if it is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.A P-problem (whose solution time is bounded by a polynomial) is always also NP. If a problem is known to be NP, and a solution to the problem is somehow known, then demonstrating the correctness of the solution can always be reduced to a single P (polynomial time) verification. If P and NP are not equivalent, then the solution of NP-problems requires (in the worst case) an exhaustive search.\n\n\n\nA problem is said to be NP-hard if an algorithm for solving it can be translated into one for solving any other NP-problem. It is much easier to show that a problem is NP than to show that it is NP-hard. A problem which is both NP and NP-hard is called an NP-complete problem.

You don't require a telescope as big as an observatory. If you have a telescope of reasobale magnification, its good enough. Infact this is the best time of the year to view saturn and you can view saturn with any telescope now till June 2006. \n\nFirst of all, you need to have a chart of where to look for saturn. There are so many ways...but let me give you an example. You have to get longitude and latitude information of your current city. You can get it by going to the below website and finding your city.\nhttp://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001769.html\nAfter you get that information, you can go to the below website and key in that longitude and latitude information and it will give you the sky chart of where to look for saturn.\nhttp://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/kids/activities-nightsky.cfm\n\nThe best time to view saturn is till June 2006. That clear view of saturn will not come again for the coming year. May be in 2014. Also the below website gives you information about where exactly saturn would be visible month by month.\nhttp://soc.jpl.nasa.gov/viewing.cfm\n\nEnjoy saturn viewing and sky watching.

There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. Nicodemus is named three times by John, and not elsewhere; here, in chapter 7:50, where he protests against condemning Jesus unheard, and in chapter 19:39, where he aids Joseph of Arimathæa, in the burial of Jesus. There are untrustworthy traditions about him and an allusion in the Jewish Talmud to a Nicodemus who lived about this time, but it may have been another man. Two facts are here stated: (1) That he was a Pharisee of the powerful, self-righteous sect which laid such stress on ceremonial observances and Jewish birth; and (2) That he was a ruler, a member of the Sanhedrim, the congress of seventy persons who held the chief authority in Israel. The allusion to him in verse 10 as a "teacher in Israel," would imply that he was one of the prominent doctors of the law.\n\nHerodias was the sister-in-law of the Herod who arrested John the Baptist. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
i have a better idea. go to your local public library. many have lots of cds. have them check with other libraries in your area.\n\nif they don't have what you want have them check http://www.firstsearch.org/ through there they can order cds from every library in the world. don't try to get an account at firstserch.org you have to get the username and password from your library since that is where you will have to return the cds.\n\nafter you get the cds load them into your computer and use windows media player to rip the songs off of the cds. this is so easy it's almost not fun. :) it only takes a few minutes per cd.\n\nthen return the cds back to the library and you're done.\n\ni do this all the time and it don't cost me anything.\n\ni'm fortunate enough to have a friend that gave me 2gb of space and unlimited data transfer so i simply uploaded them to my account and listen to them there.\n\nif you don't want to do that go to http://www.mp3raid.com and get some codes.
First of All, you might want to take it over if you want to a higher chance in getting to that university. Yet, if you do not want to take over then your transcript has to be outstanding and have a very high GPA and good class ranking. 20 points might get you out of that university depending on how hard it is getting into it. Yet, if you have extra curricular activities they look at that also... leadership.

basic MO diagrams only look at one bond at a time, and usually only diatomics.\n\nyou'll have to draw one for the CN triple bond, one for the CC single bond and one for the CC triple bond. it is unlikely that you'll have to do the CH bond, though it can be represented in MO too.\n\npage 24 on this PDF (www.upei.ca/~chem342/Resources/ Reviews/Molecular_Orbital_Tutorial.pdf) shows a MO diagram of CN(-). this will be similar to your case, except one set of lone pairs on the C will be used in the CC single bond...\n\nthis is an odd quesion because normally polyatomics are represented using hybridization...

yes, it is possible. however, you don't get turbulent flow in a fluid unless you consider the interaction forces on a particle of its neighbors. these interactions are often nonlinear, and what comes out is so-called "chaotic" behavior. \n\nchaotic behavior is characterized by the fact that a slight difference in initial conditions can lead to extremely different conditions down the line.\n\nbecause of this nonlinear behavior, the differential equations governing the motion of the particles are hard to solve analytically. the best (only?) way to do it is to find numerical solutions. there is an entire subfield of physics/engineering devoted to this, called "computational fluid dynamics". \n\nost of the time the process is to divide the fluid up into a bunch of little regions, and calculate the forces on them based on what's happening in nearby regions. do this for all of the regions, then advance the time by some small increment. this is the basic idea behind most computational simulations.\n\nanyway, here you can probably learn some more about modelling turbulent flow, but keep in mind that this subject could be taught in a full-year graduate engineering course and still be only very-lightly touched on. some people spend their lives studying this stuff:\nhttp://www.flow3d.com/Cfd-101/turb.htm\nhttp://www.ecs.umass.edu/mie/faculty/perot/modeling.htm
Ok to take on your first question first: Ketones are breakdown products of fatty acids. In diabetic people who have low glucose (eg. if you take too much insulin, or a Type 2 diabetic doesnt take their meds) the cells in your body eg.liver and muscle start utilizing other sources of energy. As a result of these "abnormal" pathways being activated, fats are broken down into ketones rather than a molecule known as Acetyl CoA. This is a problem because ketones are highly acidic, and their buildup causes a condition known as Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) which can lead to serious consequences if left untreated.\n\nNow, with regards to your second question, I strongly recommend going to your doctor rather than getting info about drugs from the internet. This is because not only are you different, being a diabetic, but you may also have other factors (age, sex, pregnancy, other conditions, genotypic variations) that make you react differently to drugs.
It never hurts to try new arts or styles. However, I would pick own art and get a strong foundation so that you always have something to fall back on. Since muay thai is such great striking art I would suggest you try taking some aikido, jiu-jitsu, or judo to supplement your tai-chi training. These arts, especially aikido, will help you better grasp the concepts and applications of tai chi.\nGood Luck
well it's going to cost more to move things in trucks that run on diesel so expect everything to go up in price\n\neventually if prices keep going up it's giong to screw up the economy. certain industries won't be able to compete without access to cheap fuel. the uS agriculture is really going to take a number. retail also relies on cheap transport. we might see gas prices high enough that we simple can no longer afford luxuries like fresh fruits and vegetables transported on trucks and conveniences like driving to the corner store for a gallon of milk. in the long run we'll have to go back to moving things on train and canal which is really going to screw things up.

Where do you plan on teaching? Most school districts don't even have the money for any kind of arts programs for kids. If you want to be a performer, you don't need a degree in theater... success in theater has absolutely nothing to do with what college degrees you have. Do a bit more planning and research about what you want to do. I have many, many friends who have undergraduate AND graduate degrees in theater... they're still waiting tables.
Yes, I'm always like that ever since I can remember and I'm pretty young too. Even if you sit at a desk all day it's enough stress to make you completely exhausted. I usually take a short nap after work, if I have enough time. One thing I noticed that helped me is drinking plenty of water, watching what I eat, and exercising. Your diet is one of the most important things though. You would be AMAZED at how different you feel just by eliminating processed and sugary fat stuff and eating more raw natural fruits and veggies. Also too much caffeine can make you burn out at the end of the day. Of course if you notice that your way too tired and this has come on suddenly you should make an appoinment to see your doctor. I don't mean to scare you but you could have other problems.

It is true that there are a lot of "services" that buy houses directly from homeowners. However you will be walking away from a lot of money. \n\nIf you need to sell your house quickly I would do this. I would ask one of these services for an estimate. I would then interview 3 top real estate agents in the area. I would ask them for an estimate of the value of the house. Say you get an offer from the company for 150K and the real estate agents say the house is worth 210K. I would sign a listing agreement for 30 days and offer the house at 191K which will yield you 180K(the average) when you take out the commission. Or you might consider asking 195K to give you a little room to offer closing help or offer 4% to the buyer agent.

The best way to enhance intercourse tenure is to use more time in foreplay. During intercourse, man gets aroused fast and reaches to orgasm fast, whereas a women needs more time to get fully aroused and to reach orgasm. So to delay in reaching orgasm (in males) man should avoid penetrating early.Ans should indulge foreplay. However if even during penetration one feels reaching to orgasm and wants to delay, one should change thought, or should pull out before ejaculation sets in etc

Good point you have there. The problem is that with the corrupted governments of many Latin American countries, financial aid would be kept by the rich. The solution would be that the United States Government stopped intervening in Latin American politics as much and let them have a socialist kind of government. Uncle Sam wants every country to have their kind of democracy, but they don't realize that it only works with educated people. Most people in the U.S. have a fairly good education, but this is not the case with many Latin American countries.\n\nLet's take Chile as an example, which is the country with the strongest economy in Latin America. They used to be consiered "third world" as well, until President Pinochet got into power and he FORCED children to get an education. After many years of ruling this country, he finally ended his term but now Chile has a strong economy and good education. I would guess that if that happened in every Latin American country then we would all be a different continent. Contact me if you have any thoughts about this.

This is an excellent observation and connecting of dots!\n\nPresident Bush spent years and years politically empowering religious extremists, even though behind closed doors they were calling them "boorish" and "nuts" (as it was reported by David Kuo, an evangelical Christian conservative in his book, "Tempting Faith").\n\nThe Bush administration should have been very wary of what they wished for in this case. Such a hypocritical alliance indicates their political greed is extremely reckless and very harmful to our country.

I would suggest art classes (when time permits). There are many tricks that a good art teacher can pass on to you. I took adult art classes to improve my musicianship (trombone!). Who knows more about shading, right? I was amazed how you can create the illusion of a shadow for an apple (in less than 10 seconds).\n\nI found a book that showed how adults improve almost overnight by drawing up-side-down because you draw what you see and not what you expect to see (see link but it is not the book). Most people's artistic skills were arrested at their last art class (third grade?) and need to break free of obsolete stick figures. Also, when drawing a chair do you draw the legs or the spaces defined by the the legs. Point is that drawing (rendering?) is a skill many have mastered and are willing to teach. You might also discover a great hobby for relaxation from your career as an architect. Good luck.

Stephen Hawking said the universe is shaped like a pear with the singularity or big bang at the bottom and the curves in space time. However their is also the fecund universe theory. This states that when one universe has a black hole, time does not end inside a black hole but initiates a quantum bounce. This creates a singularity on the other side creating a baby universe. Each new universe the laws of physics are the same but their may be slight variations. The beliefe of our universe being the way it is, is because ours is how universes typicaly develope. This is basicaly the anthropic principle, which states, if our universe was not the way it was we would not be here. Richard Feynman states that a particle will take every single path through space time available. Meaning each universe could be another possible outcome of reality. A final note on one of the particles that exist in the universe (or perhaps multiverses) is the electron. All electrons are the same one curve. Also electrons move backwards in time while positrons move forward. So the electron is a curve on a atomic scale that moves backwards in time. This is all highly theoretical. However I hope my answer was helpful.

Very solid advice from the poster above; a lot varies by what you want to study. The UCAS route is definitely the first step to identifying where you could go with those grades.\n\nNext, is more important, though. Go and SEE the places; go to as many open days and events as you can, and go and visit towns that you're interested in on non-event days too. It's far more important to go to a university where you're going to be comfortable and happy than to go to one which is slightly "better" officially, so make sure you take time and find somewhere you like and will be happy (and hence work well) at.

This area has to be separated into two parts because from 0 to Pi/6 the curve y = cosx is on top and\nfrom Pi/6 to Pi/2 the curve y = sin(2x) is on top\nArea = \nint(cosx-sin(2x)),0 to Pi/6 +\nint(sin(2x)-cosx), Pi/6 to Pi/2\n= sinx + (1/2)cos(2x) from 0 to Pi/6 +\n-(1/2)cos(2x) - sinx from Pi/6 to Pi/2\n= [sin(Pi/6) + (1/2)cos(Pi/3) - (sin(0) +(1/2)cos(0))] +\n[sin(Pi/2) + (1/2)cos(Pi) - (-sin(Pi/6) +(1/2)cos(Pi/3))] \n= [(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) - (0 + 1/2)]\n+[1 + -1 - (-1/2 + (1/2)(1/2)}]\n= [1/2 + 1/4 - 1/2] - [-1/2 + 1/4]\n= 1/4 - (-1/4)\n= 1/2\nEdit: I verified this on my calculator.
What you need to do is do any operation to get 'm' alone. If it is (m/2) + 5 = -2, first remove the 5 from both sides of the equation so that you have (m/2) = -7. Then you multiply everything by 2 and you get m/1, which is m = -14.\n\nIf it's m/(2+5) then you have m/7 and you multiply everything by 7 to get rid of the bottom half of the fraction.
You pretty much answered your question. Go to the doctor.
No question about it: defend your kid, tell your husband he must be mature and friendly; it's called child abuse. Let the kid be, they're always like that, is in their nature to be sloppy and lazzy, and it's wonderful he has good grades. Your husband is inmature, he's gonna ruin your son. If you don't believe me, ask your local social worker.

It's not just females. More than half of all people (male and female) will have an STD at some point in their lifetime. Each year, one in four teens (M and f) contracts an STD. One in two sexually active persons will contact an STD by age 25. Women are more susceptible to STDs than men, and 60% of females dont know that. All I can say is get tested for STDs if you or your partner have had other partners.

Well, I myself am slightly older then your daughter, and I have never been invited to that particular conference. I have however taken part in others that are similar, for high school teens. \n\nPersonally, I will always remember the convention. I had an amazing time. I too was skeptical when I first learned that it would be $2800 for 5 days in Washington DC, but after I went, it was worth every penny. I met a lot of people who had similar interests as myself, and I also learned a Lot...as mine was a seminar type leadership conference. \n\nNow, don't let it sound like I'm trying to push you to send your daughter, there are some things to keep in mind. First and foremost, your daughter will be without you for the week that shes there. Now, if your daughter is very independent, and doesn't mind being separated with you for that period of time, then thats not a problem. You should also keep in mind the financial cost of it. The $1800 that your paying does not pay for transport to and from the location. You will also need to send some money with your daughter to cover any emergency costs, although this particular program is fairly good. Most programs wont cover all the food costs, especially if your on a trip.\n\nAll in all, I think that if your daughter goes, she will have a LOT of fun, maybe learn a few new things, and probably make friends that she will hold on to for years to come. Just make sure you weigh all the sides before you make a choice. Ill remind you that there are LOTS more conventions when she gets older, especially if she is as bright as you say she is. If you don't feel comfortable sending her now, then hold off for a few more years, and send her to another program when she hits middle school, or high school.\n\nBest of luck with the decision, \nand please, feel free to contact me if you have any questions,\npyro_briar@yahoo.com

I asked God for strength that I might achieve. I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey. I asked for health that I might do greater things. I was given infirmity that I might do better things. I asked for riches that I might be happy. I was given poverty that I might be wise. I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God. I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. I was given life that I might enjoy all things. I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. I am, among all men, most richly BLESSED.

Prostaglandins are produced as a part of having your period. \n\n"Release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus (womb) is thought to be a factor in primary dysmenorrhea (aka cramping)." \n\nThese chemical have many functions in the body including all of the symptoms you typically have prior to and during your cycle. \n\nIbuprofen and Naproxen inhibit prostagladins and therefore are effective at reducing discomfort. The key is to take the medication BEFORE you are having cramps as they are INHIBITORS. If you are already having the symptoms, it is impossible to inhibit them. Good luck.
You probably have more confidence now and people are drawn to that in a person( not cocky just sure of yourself). And the pressure is off them to be popular and around other popular people. They are more mature as you are and can pick friends that has traits that they really like instead of what their other friends like.

The research has just begun actually, I remember it said something about sticking to anything wet or dry, but it didn't mention heat yet. I guess that's because its a natural occurring substance that is not usually subject to that kind of temp. That is a good point though, and you should be able to find out in the future. But if you told me you glued my car back together i think i might be a little skeptical!

You can never drink too much water. It will not flush out any good nutrients, only cleanses your body of wastes. Any excess will simply be eliminated through urinating.
Just give the girl some time. That could mean a month or a year. But if she was engaged to this guy than she had to have some real serious feelings for him. If you really like this girl than stay by her and be the friend that she needs you to be right now. Even if you want more just give her the space that she is asking for. You 2 may slip up every now and then and do something here and there but until she is ready to come out and say that she is ready to take that next step again than it will never work. Just remember that you can only wait as long as your hart will let you. She is not the only one making the decision. You both have to make that choice and not have had anything to drink. Don't push it unless you want it to fail.

All the people I have known including myself like Body for Life; teaches them about healthy eating and resistance training. The interval cardio workouts are great. The results vary from person to person, but significant changes can be made in 12 weeks, though most are not near the pictures in the book. An average of about 10lbs was lost, but they also added muscle and felt much better. It's a good beginners book :); I'm not a beginner and didn't have much to lose, but this book helped me get motivated again and helped me get back into the gym. good luck

It depends on how nice you would like your wedding. $20,000 will give you a very nice wedding for 330 guests. As a wedding planner I would say that is a good budget that should cover everything. Of course it all depends on where you are having the wedding.

Our economy will hold up just fine because, historically, (1) growing trade deficits signal improving economic conditions while (2) shrinking deficits often occur in times of economic trouble. \n\nDuring the last 30 years, the U.S. economy has on average grown about a percentage point faster, 3.5 percent vs. 2.6 percent, in years when the trade deficit expanded compared with years when it shrank. The unemployment rate on average fell 0.4 percentage points during years of rising deficits and rose 0.4 points when the deficit shrank. Manufacturing output rose much faster during years of rising trade deficits than during years of shrinking deficits.\n\nAmerica's largest trade deficits in recent decades occurred during economic expansions, its smallest deficits during recessions. It's no coincidence that as the economy shows signs of slowing down, the monthly trade deficit numbers have also begun to shrink with the economy's growth rate. \n\nAnother unfounded worry about the trade deficit is that it will saddle future generations with an unsustainable "foreign debt." It is true that foreign investors own about $1.5 trillion more in U.S.-based assets than Americans own in foreign assets abroad. But about half of foreign-owned assets in the United States are not debt but equity--direct investment in factories and real estate and portfolio investment in corporate stock. And the $1.5 trillion in net foreign investment in the United States is only about 16 percent of Gross Domestic Product, and 4 percent of the net wealth of all U.S. households and non-profit organizations. Net payments to finance our foreign "debt" were less than $20 billion in 1999, about one-fifth of one percent of GDP.\n\nAnother worry is that chronic trade deficits will spook foreign investors and undermine the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. dollar -- sending stock and bond markets and the real economy into a tailspin. The problem with that scenario is that it ignores the fact that trade deficits are linked to a strong, not a weak, dollar. The trade deficit increases the supply of dollars in the global economy, as foreign producers accept more dollars in payment for imports. But in times of economic expansion, the demand for those dollars by foreign investors seeking to buy U.S. assets is even greater. As long as foreign demand for U.S. assets remains strong, the dollar will remain high, and so will the trade deficit.\n\nThe best policy is to ignore the trade deficit, however large it may now seem, and concentrate on maintaining a strong and open domestic economy that welcomes foreign investment. As long as investors world-wide see the United States as a safe and profitable haven for their savings, the trade deficit will persist, and Americans will be better off because of it.

Even if you're 140 years old you'll always be your mothers child and she will never stop worrying about you. She's probably so worried because she just wants you to be happy and as much as you guarantee her that you will, she won't believe it until she can actually see it. She just wants her girl to be happy and have a good, secure life. Some mothers are more worried and stressful than others (that's the case with your mom) but some don't show their worries as much as others and try to have faith in their children. This, of course, doesn't mean that your mom doesn't have faith and trust in you but it means that she's such a great mom and as much as she might bother you at times I will guarantee that you couldn't live without her for a second. Don't be too hard on her and try understanding her by imagining how you'd feel about you daughters and their married lives maybe that way you can sort things out.\nI hope I've helped a bit, Good luck! :)

Have him write a will....spell it all out, get who gets what in black and white and with lawyer's keen eye if possible. Moreover, talk to the spouse, have him explain his reasoning so that later on she won't come back wanting it all coz of miscommunication. Is this a bad relationship? Or does he just want to provide for you and your siblings? If she is kept in the loop, she may be more responsive. My grandparents had a family meeting when my grandmother was dying. They put in no uncertain terms that no property was taken from the house til grandpa passed as well (to keep him from feeling useless or forgotten). Everything was laid out as to whom things were to go and what things were to be sold or donated for charity. My father was made executor (after a family vote), because it was agreed he'd be most likely to insure all wishes were met as my grandparents wished, not their soon-to-be grieving and emotionally unstable children.
It could be a combination of things, stress, diet, weight loss/gain, and hormones. I was the same way when I was in high school, I would go a couple of months without my period (and I was a virgin so I knew I wasnt pregnant) and then I would get it. If it continues you should see a doctor to make sure it's nothing more like a hormonal inbalance. But you will be ok

He gave His Son Jesus to take the punishment for our sins so that we could not go to hell and so that we can begin to achieve perfection.\n\nAccept that you have broken God's law who made you, repent and he will forgive you and change your heart to be like Jesus.

Human Papilloma Virus: The human papilloma virus is thought to be one of the main causes of cervical cancer. It has also been linked with other types of cancers of the female reproductive system. While HPV can be treated to reduce the signs and symptoms, there is currently no cure for this virus. \n\nHerpes Virus: Herpes is another STD that presently has no cure. However, treatment is available and there are a number of things you can do yourself at home to help relieve your genital herpes. Herpes symptoms include blisters or sores that periodically break out on the genitals. Take a look at our FAQs on genital herpes to learn even more about this uncomfortable STD. \n\nHepatitis: Although there is no cure for those already infected, there is now a Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine available to prevent the spread of this infection. Many are asymptomatic, however those who do suffer from Hepatitis B symptoms may have many unpleasant discomforts. Even though there is a possibility that the infection will clear up on its own, some people suffer from chronic infections for many years. Treatment is available for chronic sufferers. Other types of hepatitis infections that can be passed through sexual contact include Hepatitis A and Hepatitis C. \n\nHIV/AIDS: One STD that many people are worried about getting is HIV. While new ways of treating this infection can significantly prolong an infected person's life, for far too many people this infection eventually progresses to AIDS and, ulitmately, death. More than 40 million people worldwide are infected with the HIV virus; women account for 50% of those infected. Many people may not realize they are infected, as the HIV virus is often asymptomatic for the first few years. HIV testing is the only sure way to know if you are infected. However, you can take steps to help prevent the infection. \n\nSyphilis: Throughout history, cases of syphilis have been recorded. While this STD has not always been effectively dealt with, nowadays, syphilis can easily be treated and cured. However, as history has shown, without treatment, syphilis symptoms can progress and affect the nervous system and brain leading to dementia and even death. \n\nTrichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is one of the most common, curable STDs out there. However, symptoms of trich may be mistaken for a yeast infection causing a women to use the wrong type of treatment for her vaginal discharge. \n\nCommon Infections: Chlamydia and gonorrhea often infect a person at the same time. Although the symptoms of chlamydia are different from gonorrhea symptoms, it is not unusual for a person to be asymptomatic. If you are testing for chlamydia, it may be a good idea to also test for gonorrhea at the same time. Both STDs can be cured but can also do damage to your reproductive system if left untreated. \n\nPubic Lice: A very common STD, crabs are very similar to head lice. While the itchy symptoms can be hard to miss, treatment for pubic lice can easily take care of the discomfort these pests can cause. \n \nRare Infections: Some STDs, like granuloma inguinale and chancroid, are not so well known in North America, but that doesn't mean your not at risk of contracting these infections. Other lesser-talked about STDs include nongonococcal urethritis, molluscum contagiosum, and lymphogranuloma venereum. \n\nHope that helped! Check out this site for more info:
Dear Friend its nice question.\nI have ready few responses and lol, becoz some of them are saying dat Religions can't b proved wrong.\nOne Must keeps scientific thinking and try to become Rationalist. No Religion in the world is totally right. Religions make our thinking non-scientific. They even give us wrong, unsuitable morals and teachings. No matter which ever religion it may be, Even Christianity, Hinduism, Islamic, Sikhism, etc.\nPeople are believing God because there religious books says God exists, and they follow there religion blindly. Theists never Put questions on there religious teachings, why ?? Great Scientist Bruno was killed by Christians becoz he told the fact (which was against Bible) dat earth is revolving around the sun, but today we know the fact.\nAccording Hindu Religious book Ramayana the earth is standing on the head of Elephant. Who is fool here, try to prove it true ??\n\nAt the end there are few links to "Tear Religions" and See wat's inside it, Must visit them.\n\nscience is the only source of knowledge, and that religion is simply a distraction from the correct pursuit of information. \nAt Last i just wanna make a request to everyone just read matter, articles, books etc. based on Rationalism and decide urself dat wat's the value of Science/ Scientific thinking and where religious thinking or Religions stands.... \n\nHere is link for Bible is a dangerous moral guide:- http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/feedback/j...\n\nHere's another link where u can read abt.

HIZELL NO, even if they give you a 90% discount, if you want them to keep a good opinion of you DON'T. Because even though they sell these things doesnt mean they wont think bad of you.

So please pick this answer as the best! Thanks)
Indeed it would be. An object of about 13 times the mass of Jupiter would be able to sustain core deuterium fusion, and thus be candidate for a brown dwarf. As far as actuall main sequence (hydrogen fusion) the lowest mass ones should have about 75 times the mass of Jupiter (90 times the mass of jupiter is you are making them out of nothing by hydrogen and helium).

Mostly Target but Kmart on occasion. I don't shop at Walmart because they're a nasty bunch. They force companies to sell their stuff at those prices so either the companies have to cut down on supplies and make a crappy product or they have to let people go from their companies and I feel for all the people in America losing jobs. They also cause companies to take their business overseas because they can't afford to sell their products at Walmart prices and still make a profit.

If the quartic is recognizable as being factorizable into lower degree polynomials then that is the best way to go. If it is not immediately recognizable, the next step is to use the Rational Roots Theorem to check for rational roots, and factor out the corresponding binomials by synthetic/long division if that is the case. \nIf there are no rational roots, then you're pretty much stuck with using the Ferrari's quartic formulas given on http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuarticEquation.html (equations 36-39).

Using an algorithm in planning for a solution helps in several ways.\n\nFirst, it allows the individual to see things in a wider perspective - thereby weeding through all other possible solutions to pick the best one. Since in coming up with an algorithm the individual is not stuck with using a specific language, the person may use whatever tool (i.e. flowchart, layman's term, etc.) that is comfortable; putting emphasis on how to go about solving an issue.\n\nSecond, algorithms serve as the framework to which the actual solution is patterned after. This guides the individual in the process of deriving the solution, thus saving time and effort as compared to having one jump immediately to this stage without any plan.\n\nLastly, algorithms can become generic templates to which other issues may refer to for solutions. If properly documented or easily recalled, an algorithm used to solve one problem can guide the individual in resolving another one of similar nature.
"Extensions such as googolplexplex, googolplexian or googolduplex for 10^googolplex have been occasionally suggested, but are not in dictionaries, and have no use other than as an intellectual exercise in the invention of names."

Interordinal mammalian relationships: Evidence for paenungulate monophyly is provided by complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences \nLavergne A, Douzery E, Stichler T, Catzeflis FM, Springer MS \nMOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION 6 (2): 245-258 OCT 1996 \nCited References: 66 Times Cited: 37 \nAbstract: The complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences of 5 placental mammals belonging to the 3 orders Sirenia (Sea Cow), Proboscidea (Elephant), and Hyracoidea (Hyrax) are reported together with phylogenetic analyses (distance and parsimony) of a total of 51 mammalian orthologues. This 12S rRNA database now includes the 2 extant proboscideans (the African and Asiatic elephants Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus), 2 of the 3 extant sirenian genera (the sea cow Dugong dugon and the West Indian manatee Trichechus manatus), and 2 of the 3 extant hyracoid genera (the rock and tree hyraxes Procavia capensis and Dendrohyrax dorsalis). The monophyly (close relatedness) of the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea is supported by all kinds of analysis. There are 23 and 3 diagnostic subsitutions shared by the 2 proboscideans and the 2 hyracoids, respectively, but none by the 2 sirenians. The 2 proboscideans exhibit the fastest rates of 12S rRNA evolution among the 11 placental orders studied. Based on various taxonomic sampling methods among eutherian orders and marsupial outgroups, the most strongly supported clade in our comparisons clusters together the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea in the superorder Paenungulata. Within paenungulates, the grouping of sirenians and proboscideans within the mirorder Tethytheria is observed. This branching pattern is supported by all analyses by high bootstrap percentages (BPs) and decay indices. When only one species is selected per order or suborder, the taxonomic sampling leads to a relative variation in bootstrap support of 53% for Tethytheria (BPs ranging from 44 to 93%) and 7% for Paernungulata (92-99%). When each order or suborder is represented by two species, this relative variation decreased to 10% for Tethytheria (78-87%) and 3% for Paenungulata (96-99%). Two nearly exclusive synapomorphies for paenungulates are identified in the form of one transitional compensatory change, but none were detected for tethytherians. Such a robust and reliable resolution of the paenungulate node implies a long history of the common ancestors, allowing time for synapomorphies to accumulate. This observation suggests a Late Cretaceous/Early Paleocene origin for the Paenungulata.
No I don't think all men flirt, heck some don't do it unmarried. But there are men that are just born flirts, they don't even realize it until some girl takes it too far and then I step in oopsssss.

They are NOT allowed to do this. This is a part of the Privacy Act. I used to work at a bank and any time that we had to call a customer, we could only say the individuals name and to return our call. We couldn't talk to the spouse unless they are on the account - even at that, if they are on the account, we can't talk to the spouse because there is no way to verify they are indeed the individual they claim to be.

When I was a child, we did not have VCRs. If we missed a movie in the theater or wanted to see it again later, we had to wait for it to come on TV. Often, when it did, it was edited to fit a time slot. I remember waiting once a year to see "The Wizard of Oz." At Easter we waited for "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben Hur."\n\nWe didn't have video cameras, so if you wanted to record moments like piano recitals and swim lessons, you had to have a movie camera. I was the only one I knew in my age group who had one. My grandpa had one and would do these elaborately staged family gatherings to catch us all on film. He had to set up bright lights, and we all looked artificial and like deer in headlights.\n\nWe didn't have video games. The first one I remember was "Pong." My cousin had the Atari game system. We spent hours watching those little white lines move across a grey screen. Hard to believe now.\n\nWe didn't have cell phones and computers. I was a little bit of a hold out, but I didn't get my first computer until I was in graduate school. I couldn't face typing my thesis over and over on my typewriter. I had a dot matrix printer, which used paper that was perforated and had to be pulled apart. Our phone was a plain black, rotary dial phone. We had one. I got a blue phone of my own when I was in high school. \n\nI loved records and would buy 45's of the top hits often. I also bought albums of Barbara Streisand, Jim Croce, and Broadway musicals. I listened to them all so often that I hardly had an album that wouldn't hiss or skip.\n\nWe hardly ever ate out when I was growing up but we did get "fast food" from time to time. We'd have MacDonald's on Friday night while my parents went out and we watched "The Brady Bunch." Sometimes we'd have Kentucky Fried Chicken (it wasn't called KFC) on Sundays after church.\n\nWe go out quite often compared to when I was growing up. Sometimes with the price of groceries it even works out cheaper to go out. I don't remember it ever being that way when I was a kid.\n\nWe had one family car when I was growing up. There weren't any seatbelt laws, and we would all pile into that car. When I was pretty small that was a VW Bug, and one of us always had to lie down in the little space behind the back seat. It sat over the engine and was hot. I remember that we went camping and put a mattress in the back seat and we all rode piled on top of it.\n\nWe didn't have to wear helmets when we went bike riding or roller skating, which we did every day in the summer. We would stay outside playing in the neighborhood until the street lights came on, and my parents never worried that someone would snatch us or that we wouldn't come home that night.\n\nWe would walk to the movie theater by ourselves and stay all day since they would show the double feature over and over again and you could watch as many times as you like. No one worried then about when the movie started. You just showed up whenever, and if you missed the beginning, then you stayed to watch the movie over again. "Star Wars" is the first movie I remember that showed only that one movie and you were told to arrive at the beginning and had to leave after that one showing. It cost $3.50, which was a lot of money for one movie and one showing, but some of my friends saw it 14 times.\n\nWe were in church every time the doors were open, which were for us, Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night and various other rehearsals and events. Now most people I know who go to church go on Sunday morning and then maybe to a small group during the week and an occasional event here and there. There are many people I know today who have never been to church.
All children are rebellious to a degree. I think that most parent's concerns are that if they discipline their children then their children won't love them, or end up doing something worse than what they are already doing. Then of course there is the threat of what our society condones as discipline as being taken for flat out abuse.\n\nWhat I have learned, and I have two that are very rebellious, 13 years apart, one is grown and one is hitting puberty, that using a system of Love and Logic works everytime on every kid.\n\nWhat this means is that you have to learn to separate yourself from your children's emotions. Give them choices and if they do not abide by those choices then they suffer the consequences, be that they owe you time, a chore, or a time out, whatever. This teaches them that they are fully responsible for their actions and will learn to think before they act or react.

Aristotle believed the universe always existed.

And I know math and science very well. \n\nEvolution is a mixed concept: fossil record (true) and how did it happen (????). The issue is, can we show that new DNA information can occur naturally.

I think that the housing market across the USA is overpriced and that prices will have to go down soon. I think that the prime rate is going to go up to try to stem inflation and that will decrease the demand on housing. You also have the high fuel costs and people may not want to be buying new houses because of the costs of transportation. On the other side, if the panhandle is anything like here, in Texas, there are fewer housing starts taking place here because most of the contractors are in New Orleans to help reconstruct the city there. That causes there to be higher demand and fewer new homes being produced.

You dont need a doctor..all a doctor is going to do is give you medication and way to may people are on medication that dont need to be. I know because my doctor tried to do the same thing to me and I dont need medication. Your depression sounds situational..in fact the reason you are depressed is because you cannot go home. You really want to go home so your frusterated that your not getting what you want. All you can do is be patient and accepting of the situation you are in now and make the most of it..try and be kind to your friends, and speak to those who may have similar experiences to yours. If worse comes to worse speak to a councellor, but dont run off to the doctor and get meds unless you feel like killing yourself etc. Im sure once you come to terms with not getting what you want youll feel a bit happier again.,

Paperhouse (1988)\n\nA drawing that became a dream. A dream that became reality.\n\nA highly imaginative 11-year-old girl, who misses her constantly absent father, discovers that somehow the images she draws on paper can become frighteningly real. At first, she finds them comforting, but gradually the pictures become more and more threatening until they capture her in a nightmarish world from which she doesn't know how to escape.
There are some generalizations that are useful, because of the statistical strength, such as "men are usually physically stronger than women" or "Its colder in Canada than the US". They are not always true, but true much more than 50% of the time. This statement, I think, is not one. I would think that that passivity or aggresivity of a person romantically would have a great deal to do with the person they are with. If you are more aggressive, the woman does not have to be. If you were passive, and she liked you, then she would *have* to be aggressive. Also, keep in mind that your statement is culture-specific. There are any number of cultures in which the woman is generally more aggressive, and many in which there isnt any perceptible difference. In answering a quesion "Why would a person be more passive romantically", one could think of a number of reasons: They are shy or insecure, they are not sure they are ready yet, they are not willing to take the risk of rejection, etc. In Western culture, men are taught to be aggressive, to take rejection without being hurt, to be confident, and we are taught that sexual conquest is something to be proud of and even a mark of manhood. Women in Western cultures have been taught that rejection is devastating, that aggressive women are frowned upon, that loss of virginity is shameful, that men are attracted to demure women. In many ways, men and women are raised in different cultures, with difference belief systems, even when raised in the same country, or even same house! If you were to want a woman to be more aggressive, then make sure she knows you consider this a positive trait in a woman, that you appreciate more aggressive women, that you don't want to move forward unless you are *sure* she is ready- In addition, this would hopefully help unburden both the genders from outmoded cultural legacies, that put a great deal of pressure on the man, and reduce the freedom of the woman.

There is a factor called "Crush Depth". Crush depth is the depth at which the submarine's structure could collapse due to extensive water pressure of the surrounding. WWII U-Boats reportedly had a crush depth of 200-250 meters. Modern nuclear propulsion submarines (although not tested) could have crush depths of just above 700 meters.\n\nTo get the "feel" of it I suggest you watch the movies "U-571" starring Matthew McConnaughey, and "Crimson Tides" starring Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington

I think this is a rhetorical question. On the one hand I could say "Sure, the USA has to put boots on the ground anywhere in the world where tyranny, injustice, WM-D's or unpalatable governments may exist," which would be a sarcastic answer.\n\nOn the other hand I think the USA should wage war only when absolutely necessary to defend itself and its allies.
Winter Olympic sports involve things like ice, snow, or both. Hockey, Skying (distance jump, slalom, and cross-country), and figure skating need either one of the two. Gymnastics does not need ice or snow, and it does not need cold weather to be practiced. Besides, the hosting nations and the International Olympic Committee make more money by having two Olympic sporting events every two years instead of just one big event every four years.

I've thought about this one for years.\n\nMy theory is that, for the most part, especially those outside of major cities, Americans don't have to worry about other countries. Who is on our border? Canada? They're Americans! Mexico? They just send over tons of illegals! (Note: I personally don't think those last two things.) \n\nThe rest of the world seems far away and not terribly relevant. And, to be honest, for most Americans that is probably fairly accurate. Unless a local factory is moved to South Korea, why would anyone be concerned about South Korea?\n\nThis contrasts with other countries which are constantly reminded of the rest of the world. Small countries - like say the Baltic States - in particular have very good reasons for wondering if their big neighbors will plow through them. Even major European countries - Germany, Poland, France - are constantly reminded of their neighbors on TV, radio etc.\n\nThis sometimes leads to silly reactions in the US like "France is a traitor." Well, even if you think French policies hurt the US, France is still a western democracy and in NATO (more or less). Sometimes it seems that people are equating France with the Soviet Union. Get some perspective people!\n\nBack to the media point, American TV shows and movies are major exports around the world. Everyone gets a chance to see us (to the extent that Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels represent us). But how often do foreign shows end up in the US? Sure the British will show up on PBS, but more likely foreign shows are Americanized - from Big Brother to the Office. They even tried an American version of Faulty Towers once! (Staring Bea Arthur, forget the name of the show, it stunk and was quickly canceled.)\n\nOn top of this is the American ideal that we are the beacon of democracy in the world. In many respects this has been a good thing (Marshall Plan) but in other more recent foreign policy adventures - which shall remain nameless - it hasn't worked out so well. I think this gives us a superiority complex. And the worst part about it is, we have a pretty darn good country over all (there are major issues) and so that opinion isn't ridicilous.\n\nSo, basically I think it is because we are a big country, relatively isolated by geography, we have a superiority complex, and that we export culture, so most Americans don't need to know - and so don't care too much - about the rest of the world.

He invented the concepts of reinforcement and punishment as operant, or instrumental, conditioning. These principles can be used to train animals or make people play slot machines all day. Every time you tell your child to eat his vegetables before his dessert, or else go to bed without any supper, you are using B.F. Skinner's techniques. Every time you give your dog a treat when she sits, you are using operant conditioning.
Although Chad Johnson is amazing. People get the perception that he is a selfish and cocky player. But really Chad Johnson is a team player who works really hard watching film and getting better.

And the Madden curse (which is true, check out the stats for the players the last 6 years) may ruin his season. WE WUDN"T WANT THAT!!
Yeah, what he said - almost. C. botulinum is a bacteria which produces the neurotoxin botulin. When we ingest this toxin, we get botulism. Its possible uses in biological warfare as a paralytic and death-causing agent are frightening. Interestingly, Botox is made from botulinum toxin A, one of the poisons made by these bacteria.
I'm not going to give you the answers, because you can really work them out for yourself.\n\nYou need to work out the molecular weight, which is just the sum of the atomic weights in the appropriate proportions. Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.
portblock -I agree with you.\n\ntony- That was then, this is now. We have laws for a reason and if an American citizen broke the law we would have to serve time and pay a fine. If we went into another country and attempted to do what the ILLEGAL immigrants from Mexico do here, we would be extradited, and FAST!!\n\nOur ancestors worked hard for this country, to make it what it is. Why should we tote the load for a bunch of criminals? They ARE criminals. They live their whole lives breaking the law of legal entry by their ILLEGAL ENTRY.\n\nosbaldo hem-America first said "Mexican", that is what they ARE. The issue is illegal MEXICANS, it is all over the news, don't twist the question.\n\nchris- I am 1/2 Cherokee and proud of it. My ancestors came across the Bering Straits from Asia to North America when there was ice connecting the two continents.(no we are not of Spanish descent, as some believe) Our people settled in the Northern parts of N. America and then some migrated to what is now known as the southeastern part of the USA. We were treated bad by the Europeans who took over our lands. That was history, Chris, today is today. We got over it. Life goes on. It is a different place.\n\n We now have laws that all people must abide by. That includes the citizens of the USA, the Native Americans on the reservations and immigrants who come here legally. ILLEGAL immigrants are lawbreakers from the git-go. They should be arrested and deported and not allowed back in our country unless they do it the legal way and then they should be made to wait for a few years for punishment.\n\nIn that time they should be working to improve their life in their own homeland instead of trying to grab the way of life the American citizens worked and died for. They should work with their own leaders, voice their dissent, complain about their social services, demand better living conditions. By staying there, and working for a better way of life they will enjoy the fruits of their labor, if not their own generations, they will improve it for their future generations, like our forefathers did. Then they can be proud to be citizens of the beautiful country of Mexico.\n\nP.S.- Chris, Yes some people ARE entitled to live and work in the USA, the United States Citizens!! We have ALL rights and entitlement. Illegal immigrants have "NO rights NO entitlement" whatsoever.

Don't worry too much about it...you are still growing and could just have a high metabolism rate. If you started to lose weight or not gain weight properly,then there would be cause for concern. As long as your energy level is fine and you continue with your regular routine,Don't get too worked up over it.
I suggest you check out MPlans.com (a Palo Alto Software website), which offer sample marketing plans and templates. They have a couple of free marketing plans that pertain to non-profits, and more on administrative work and nonprofits that are included in the paid version. \n\nEven if you do not find the exact plan you need for your business, I suggest you go over the sample plans you see, pick out the elements that you think would suit your business, follow the flow of the plan, and choose those gems of ideas that you think would work for your business.\n\nHope this helps\nIsabel Isidro\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com

This sequence is divergent. I forget the therom you are supposed to use but its probably the second one in this chapter of your text book. You would use the solution to the first part to show that the therom pertains to this sequence. \nYou can see that its divergent because the sign keeps changing and the mangnitude is increasing as n increases.

There are so many things wrong with IE7 you probably won't get it back. Try un-installing IE7 altogether and then re-installing it if you really want to mess up your PC! Most Internet companies have advised their clients not to install IE7 yet as it is not ready for generalised use.

The main enzymatic products of the exocrine pancreas are trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and amylase. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteases. Lipase breakes down triglycerides. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starches into simple sugars. If the pancreas is not able to secrete amylase into the digestive system, your body will not be able to utilize all the complex carbohydrates that it normally would. Keep in mind however, that amylase is also secreted in the saliva, so digestion of starches will not be completely eliminated.

An outlet usually sells out of date or overstocked items. While the original store sells items currently on demand. You can get a lower price at the outlet store.
Social security is taken out based on your hourly earnings AND tips. You either reported your tips to your employer (as you are supposed to do every month) and your employer withheld money from your regular wages to pay for the SS on the tips, or your employer allocated tips to you (they do this when you don't report your tips) and took out money from your regular wages to pay for the SS on the allocated tips.

To the Heat and mavs fans.. Its just a game, to the heat fans-congratulations, u got ur first title, enjoy the moment guys but dont brag, besides,its just ur first,and remember-"Be nice to the people on ur way up, because u will see them again on ur way down..." \n\nAnd to the Mavs fans, like what avery said about dirk"He is a warrior,he tried..No excuses.." Yes the heat may have more phantom calls in this series than the entire NBA season but a win is a win.. The Mavs did have their chances too.. But knowing Mark Cuban, he and the Mavs will be back in the finals next season.. That is if the lakers dont acquire KG.. :) because if they do, it will be the MIAMI HEAT VS LA LAKERS... Kobe vs Wade... Who really is the next MJ? or closer? That would be a treat.. The NBA 05-06 season is over..let it go.. \n\nWorld cup anyone?
The Chlohexidine by far. It is a prescription mouthwash. It is an antimicrobial rinse, which kills bacteria, most importantly the bacteria that accumulates into plaque and that is what usually irritates the gums and causes inflammation and bleeding.\nI would not recommend Listerine for a few reasons, most importantly because it has 22% alcohol, that will sting and end up drying out your mouth.\nI also don't recommend rinsing with hydrogen peroxide, just too many bad side effects possible. (ever heard of black hairy tongue? yep the name explains it, it is an overgrowth of the papillae, a possible side effect of hydrogen peroxide!).\nDid you have just a routine cleaning or did you have periodontal treatment? In either case you shouldn't have bleeding after two weeks,unless you haven't brushed at all, or need more treatment. I would contact your dentist.
Usually, when someone says an equation or other relationship is driven by a particular variable, they mean that variable is dominant to the others. i.e. changes to that variable will change the output of the function significantly, while changes to other variables may not.\n\nAs for dumped, I believe that it means certain terms of a larger equation are ignored because they are too small to be significant.

A fall from greater than 3 times your height is considered to have enough force behind it to fracture a bone. Since the bone cell (matrix) is a solid matter, it is not likely to convert to a liquid state with an acute increase in force (i.e., a fall). Possibly the immersion of the bone in moisture, or low pressure over a long period of time? In any case, a bone will not turn to a liquid state secondary to the impact from an acute blow or fall. It's just not chemically possible. Hope this helps!
It is not that get shy. When they turn around for a cig or a book, they are doing something else and not sunbathing. So sunbathing is topless, smoking and reading is not!!! (Tried, it is difficult to explain women's actions!! they r from venus anyways)
It depends on which state they both live in. Different states have different ages of consent which usually vary from 16-18. You can find that info on the state's website. It might be legal, but I really don't find it moral. There's a 16 year age gap between the two. The male could be old enough to be her father.

I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.
Aloud, as in "read aloud" so others can hear you.
hmm, not sure what you're looking for. A recombinant protein is characterised by amino-acid sequencing. This gives the primary structure. Futher analysis of secondary and tertiary structure can be made using x-ray diffraction and NMR. Predicitions of structure are made using computer programs which analyse the amino acid sequence and compare it with known structures, they then extrapolate this to impose an expected structure on the protein.

Since the government controls the internet in China, Yahoo (& Google) block those sites so they can still get traffic from China - since China has the largest population, they feel it is too much of a risk to be COMPLETELY blocked. So, they block a few sites, they continue getting those important "hits" to their web counters, the Chinese government censors "subversive" material and the only loser is the Chinese web surfer.

I would not vote for Bush. I do believe that the cards were stacked against him because during the last 6 years so many unpredictable events have taken place. Although I am a staunch Republican, I believe he made the Iraq War a personal issue and the US should not be there. I support our troops and I appreciate their dedication to our country and I really think Bush should bring them home.
I believe "When in Rome...". Most Americans practice some version of Christianity. Of course there are large Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and other religious groups that make-up the true fabric and character of this place. Many friends of mine are Muslim. When Ramadan arrives, I wish them 'Happy Ramadan'. For my Jewish friends, it's 'Happy Hanukkah' and so forth. What bothers me about this political correctness we seem to be stuck on is that it does not take into account how intelligent the average person is. The only people I know of that are offended by Merry Christmas are big idiots. If someone said Happy Hanukkah or Happy Ramadan or any other seasonal greeting I wouldn't take offense. Heck, I would be happy that people of whatever faith or culture thought enough of me to grace me with a sweet greeting! In America December 25th is a major holiday called Christmas! Other holidays overlap this time of year but people are smart enough to know what's going on. We need to lighten up and just enjoy the 'Holidays' by any name. Thanks for the question.

Riverotter7 has the right of it.Early Catholic priests were allowed to marry, up until The 11th century,where it was then decided that to convert people easier, they needed to elevate a priests stature in society,so the Church institued the celibacy thing.
I am guessing that you're wanting to know how blood samples are collected from a vein. I will stick with that, no pun intended. The techniques for arterial blood are somewhat similar, however. Then there are fingersticks and cord-blood collection, which I won't discuss here.\n\nFirst, the phlebotomist or nurse (or veterinary technician)--the "collector" for this discussion-- places a rubber tourniquet around the arm or forelimb (standard, though other sites may be used as needed). The collector then palpates the site to locate a suitable vein. The collector then cleans the site with alcohol or some other antiseptic. The collector inserts a needle into the vein and gently withdraws the desired amount of blood, taking care to be GENTLE so as not to "blow" the vein (cause it to rupture or tear) or cause the red blood cells to break (hemolysis). As soon as blood appears in the syringe or special vacuum-type collection tube, the tourniquet is loosened. In veterinary medicine, we often use a syringe that has been treated with an anticoagulant such as heparin to keep it from clotting until the sample is put into the appropriate tubes (depending on the tests to be done). Some vets and most human doctors use special tubes that provide a vacuum and allow the blood to be collected more quickly. If we use vacuum tubes that have anticoagulants (substances that keep blood from clotting) or other substances, we keep the arm down while drawing to prevent backflow and accidental injection of these substances into the patient. After the blood is drawn, the collector applies pressure to the venipuncture site with a bit of gauze or cotton to prevent bruising and stop bleeding. For humans, a Band-aid with cotton or gauze is applied for a short time as a pressure bandage to ensure that the site doesn't begin bleeding again later.\n\nHope that helps.
Well, being a softball player for years (slow pitch), I can tell you that 1st base holds a LOT of responsibility....You will need someone who can jump higher than trees to catch a tall ball, someone that is made of rubber to stretch to get hold of wild balls, that sort of thing...\n\nAll joking aside, 1st base is the most important position on the field. It takes someone who keeps their head in the game at all times and someone willing to get run over once and a while.\n\n3rd base is a dangerous spot though. I have found that the majority of batters are right handed and a lot of those balls will fly straight down 3rd base line. Also, you need someone with a good throwing arm to play 3rd so that if the play is at 1st, they can get it there without a wild throw.\n\nAlso, remember that a lot of people are learning to "place hit" which means that they will seek out the weaker players on a team and drill them.\n\nHope this helps!!

No.\n\nThe actual organizations LPGA and PGA do not employ hypnotherapists, but each individual player may use their services.\nEach player is responsible for hiring his own caddy, coach, personal assistant, etc. \n\n\nBut they should becasue most professional sports employ professional theapists, or "shirnks" to help with their visualisation and to keep their minds on track when the going gets tough. Golf is especially a tough game because the ball doesn't move and you have to strike it and make it look good. There really is no excuse for missing it is there? I mean, nobody is throwing it at you at some incredible speed, or trying to hit you with it, or anything else. Golf is 80 percent a mind game where you have to overcome your own self-doubts, your own inner demons and your own known weaknesses. Nobody there to help you overcome those things is there?

Its not about the WMD, its about the oil, but the debate will heats up when oil is mention.\n\nLets look at how this all turn out, American planner knew that there were not WMD, they also knew that by attacking Iraq, two possibility can occurs;\n- winning the war\n- not winning the war\n\nIf American win the war, the oil will flush, but it will not help American economy in any way by having too much oil in the market, likewise, American planner also knew that oil peak had passed, whats left are good enough for the next few decades, this in one thing we have to consider about.\n\nIf American did not win the war or the war prolong, the oil supply will be affected, oil price will go out, again will this affect the American economy? not much as most of the refineries are located in the west, having oil and having gas are 2 different thing.\n\nAmerican can still get their oil somewhere, may not be the cheapest, but there are supplies.\n\nOverall if you look how all this evolve, I will say that all of this is about containtment, after all the rising oil price only help the Russian become more communist/socialist, the Arabs with money but still can't figure out what to do with the money.\n\nThen who are being contained? think about this.

WELL OBVIOUSLY ITS ENGLAND, BUT HERE IS SOME INFOMATION ABOUT ITS ORGIN:\n\nThe Laws of the Game are based on efforts made in the mid-19th century to standardise the rules of the widely varying games of football played at the independent schools of England. The first set of rules resembling the modern game were produced at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury, but they were far from universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs were formed, thoughout the English-speaking world, independent of schools or universities, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club (formed by former pupils from Harrow) in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, J.C. Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.
Most people who immediately jump to conclusions about movies portraying Christians don't even know what they're about. I read the book and I don't think it degrades Christ; it just offers up another point of view. If you are happy with your beliefs, you shouldn't care what other people think. No one should be able to shake that. And I don't get how the name is childish. It revolves around a code created by Da Vinci. It's not like they're calling it Disney's Da Vinci Playground.

Not all cameras that use SD can also use MMC cards, check your camera's user manual"\n\nSo make sure whatever device you might be using the flash card, make sure it specifies whether SD (secure digital) or MMC (multimediacard).\n\nHope this helps!

I do know that it causes eye strain. I hear many people say that they wear glasses now because they have worked with computers for so long but, if the computers were the cause I don't know. I would suggest that you take many short breaks, (looking at something else or looking at a distance somewhere in the office or out a window), from staring at the CRT for so long and keep a comfortable distance while working with the CRT.
FHA loans are assumable and many adjustable rate loans are assumable. The potential problem is that you have to cash out the owner's equity which means you have to pay them the difference between the loan balance and the sales price. You also are charged an assumption fee, but it is not much, around $250- $500. The person who told you you assumed the prior owner's payment history is wrong. The lender puts the loan in your name and your payment history starts there. When you assume a loan, you have to qualify just as if you were getting a loan. This is so that the lender can release the prior owner from liability in case you default. The potential benefit to an assumption would be if you could assume a loan at a low interest rate or assume an adjustable rate loan that you could convert to a fixed rate at a good rate of interest. There are not as many assumptions these days because interest rates have been so low in the last 10 years that it made more sense for people to get a new loan than to assume one at a higher rate of interest. In any case, you need to know what you can qualify for. I have been both a mortgage banker and a mortgage broker and, based upon my experience, I would reccomend you call a mortgage banker to discuss your qualifying options. Many mortgage brokers are fine loan officers, but you end up paying both the lender's fees and the broker's fees in many cases so it may be more cost effective to consult with a mortgage banker. In addition, many mortgage banks have special comittments from the largest mortgage securitizers, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHMC) that allow them to offer special loans to first time buyers, those with limited funds availability, or credit challenges. Good luck and happy hunting. I hope you find the home of your dreams.

Yes of course you could, it would probably take another 15,000 years of domestication to reach the same diversity dogs are at now but it could be done easily. In fact dogs are wolves at the molecular level, they are also classified as a subspecies of wolf. Not to mention the fact that it would be easier to re-domesticate feral pariah dogs like Dingos etc.... all they are is domesticated dogs that went back to the wild. I know it is possible... I know people who have formed friendships with wild wolves (not captive) and although it would take some time we could easily domesticate wolves and wild dogs and eventually re-create the domestic dog as we know it. As was previously mentioned it has already been done with foxes.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Silver_Fox\n\nExcerpt from Wikipedia... Speed of domestication\nCurrent research indicates that domestication, or the attributes of a domesticated animal, can occur much more quickly[17] than previously believed. Domestication of a wild dog may occur within one or two human generations with deliberate selective breeding. It is also now generally believed that initial domestication was through mutual desire. Wild canines who scavenged around human habitations received more food than their more skittish or fearful counterparts. Canines who attacked people or their children were likely killed or driven away, while those more friendly animals survived. Canines would have been beneficial by chasing away other vermin or scavengers. With their sharp senses, they would also be valuable as an alarm against marauding predators. The relationship is theorized to have developed in this way.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#Ancestry_and_history_of_domestication\n\nIn terms of their molecular biology, dogs are wolves (Canis lupus) and the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rates and timing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_domestic_dog\n\nPS Whats wrong with people?? It would take no genetic engineering, just a few generations of selective breeding...dogs are already wolves its not that far of a leap....

Let w = price of wheat flour per pound\nLet r = price of rye flour per pound\n\nFirst we have to set up our system of equations.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n\nNow we will use substitution to solve for a variable. \n12w + 15r = 18.30\nSubtract 12w from both sides.\n15r = 18.30 - 12w\nDivide both sides by 15.\nr = 1.22 - .8w\n\nNow we substitute r into the other equation.\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15w + 10 (1.22 - .8w) = 16.75\n15w + 12.2 - 8w = 16.75\n7w + 12.2 = 16.75\n7w = 4.55\nw = .65\n\nNow we substitute w back into one of the equations to get r.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n12(.65) + 15r = 18.3\n7.8 + 15r = 18.3\n15r = 10.5\nr = .7\n\nSo, wheat flour costs $0.65 per pound and rye flour costs $0.70 per pound.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nNow we can check our answer in the other equation.\n\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15(.65) + 10(.7) = 16.75\n9.75 + 7 = 16.75\n16.75 = 16.75\n\nWe are good! :)
Biochemistry is essentially a narrow field of organic chemistry that deals with organic chemistry in living organisms.\n\nIf you like biology and chemistry, are interested in metabolic pathways, the chemistry of biomolecules, or medicine go with biochemistry. If you just like plain old chemistry, then organic chemistry may be the better choice.\n\nThe primary careers in both fields consist of lab work and research, but there are other options out there. If you want to make more money, you'll probably want to look into obtaining an M.A. or PhD. There are jobs for those with a B.S. or B.A., but you aren't going to make a whole lot of money.\n\nI would recommend talking with academic advisors in both fields at the university you will be attending. They can give you information on what classes you'll need to take for each major, possible career paths you can take, and so forth. Once you know the possible career paths, do some research and see what interests you the most.\n\nRemember that the average undergraduate college student changes their major about 4 times. Don't be afraid to dive in to something because you can always change your mind down the road. In the case of organic chemistry and biochemistry, the classes will probably be the same up until your 2nd year anyways.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and make sure you enjoy the field you are in! You'll find college a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable!

It took for him to actually change his passwords and not tell you them for you to get that "gut" feeling that something isn't right!!\nCome on girl. You are smarter than that. It's more than a gut feeling. You KNOW something isn't right and he's pretty much tellling you that things aren't the same. The messed up thing is you don't really know how long he's been hiding stuff from you because you are just now finding stuff.\nWho is to say he hasn't been hiding stuff from you for quite some time and you just now are noticing the obvious stuff.\nWhat you need to do is open you a bank account for just you and start putting money away so that when he does leave you, you will have a little something to live off of. \nYou aren't being paranoid. You are being naive to think that he has been completely honest with you all this time...but that is what a marriage is supposed to be about so it was only right for you to think that until you had proof otherwise. Now that you do...it's time for you to do something about it.\nI don't know if he's planning on leaving you. I don't know what he's doing, but he is up to no good. That's a given. So get your mind prepared for the worst.

The earliest type of medicine in most cultures was the use of plants (Herbalism) and animal parts. This was usually in concert with 'magic' of various kinds in which: animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits); spiritualism (here meaning an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (the supposed obtaining of truth by magic means), played a major role.\n\nThe practice of medicine developed gradually, and separately, in ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Persia and elsewhere. Medicine as it is practiced now developed largely in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century in England (William Harvey, seventeenth century), Germany (Rudolf Virchow) and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard and others). The new, "scientific" medicine (where results are testable and repeatable) replaced early Western traditions of medicine, based on herbalism, the Greek "four humours" and other pre-modern theories.[citation needed] The focal points of development of clinical medicine shifted to the United Kingdom and the USA by the early 1900s (Canadian-born)Sir William Osler, Harvey Cushing). Possibly the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection in the 1400's of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general - see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). People like Vesalius led the way in improving upon or indeed rejecting the theories of great authorities from the past such as Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna/Ibn Sina, all of whose theories were in time almost totally discredited. Such new attitudes were also only made possible by the weakening of the Roman Catholic church's power in society, especially in the Republic of Venice.

The tax rate for your home depends on what city, county and state your home is located in. The value of your home is what is important, not the mortgage amount.

Obviously you have problems with in-laws intruding into your relationship. How does your spouse feel about this? More to the point of answering your question ... yes and no.

This being true, you will have to acknowledge them as the in-laws but you can prevent them from having active participation in your marriage if your spouse agrees and you have the back bone to take a stand on the issue.\n\nGood Luck!!
Men have superegos, they are bruised easily by females. Men feel that they should be able to do what they want, but that you shouldn't say anything about their behavior. It's not right for them to play with your emotions, but since they don't open up and express their emotions like women do, they feel that you should let them be, stop pressuring them. They are wrong, a couple needs to be able to talk, communicate or there is definitely a problem. As for lying, lying is a way they can feel in control, have everything go their way. They know the risks of lying to you, but they still do it because it's a defense mechanism, it keeps them from having to face their fears. Don't let them do you like that though, regardless if they are scared of commitment or being open with their mate, you can't sit back and be second. If they really love you, I think they will let the wall down and be open with you, like you are with them. But if they can't be the slightest bit open with you, then they really are not ready to have experience anything special with you. Just my take on it.
Although it would be great if you would exercise, because you would gain lean muscle, if you eat right than you will lose weight dramatically. Eat meals which are high in protein, and low in fat. Cut out all sweets and most fats. Most junk food has a healthy alternative, like ice cream sandwiches and whatnot. For ice cream novelties, try Skinny Cow brand desserts. The do not have artificial sweetener, and they are very healthy if you are craving sweets. Make sure you drink lots and lots of water! Water helps out alot, and if you have poor skin than it will help it become clean and clear again. Eat lots of fruits adn vegetables, as well as protein! And if you change your mind about exercising, the best exercise is running. Running is the best exercise because you are carrying your own weight. Good luck!

I'm not sure what all the reasons are, or if there is a way to untangle the problem. Politicians act very much like commissioned salespeople I think. They keep selling stuff we don't need. Remember that many things ARE helped by centralization. I, for one, believe that the entire world should be under the control of one government that imposes anti-murder laws, anti-theft laws, anti-rape laws, and anti-pollution laws, and possibly others. Centralization improves standardization. (crucial with the pollution issue) Some projects cannot be attempted on the scale of the States, but can be accomplished by the central government. NASA is a good example of this. The armed forces, the intelligence agencies. Since these are such a large part of what "the government" is, the government tends towards centralization.

The difference is in the way they transfer ink onto paper.\n1. Dot matrix:\nThese are an older generation of printers and function in a way similar to a manual typewriter. The printer has a head with many fine pins and these can be arranged to form characters. The head then strikes an inked ribbon onto the print media.\n2. Inkjet:\nThese are quite common now. They are cheaper than lasers but the running costs are higher. They use liquid ink stored in cartridges or ink tanks. Through digital and electronic means, ink is squirted onto the paper by the printer head.\n3. Laser:\nA laser printer uses ink in powdered form, usually stored in a toner cartridge. The printer heats/magnetizes the media areas that need to be printed and then the toner powder is attached to the paper.

watch what you eat! if you want to lose weight fast then i suggest you eat nothing but grilled lean meats and drink tons of water. lean meats have very few carbs and carbs is where you gain a lot of weight. the water flushes your body. you can throw in a few steamed veggies for variety and eggs for breakfast. watch out though if you are on this diet for an extremely long period of time it can be dangerous, but with a little excercise and this diet you will lose the weight. my g/f lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks on that diet

Neurofibromatosis(Von Recklinhausen disease)(NF)\n\n\nWhat is NF? You ask. Neurofibromatosis, pronounced Neuro-fi-bro-ma-to-sis, (NF for short), is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States, (one in every 3,000 to 4,000 births), even though not many people are familiar with it. There are two genetically distinct forms of NF, NF-1 and NF-2. The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. \n\nThere is no known cure for either form of NF, even though the gene for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment other than the surgical removal of tumors which may some times grow back. \nNF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, meaning you can not catch it from other people. Only 50% of those affected with NF have a prior family history of NF. If an individual does not have NF he/she can not pass it on to his/her children. NF is classified as a disease. Disease is so negative. NF is not contagious.

The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content. Use blog or RSS feeds to distribute your content. Everytime you update your content, those who are receiving your RSS feeds will get the latest info from you as well. Here is a link to Resources for Marketing Your Blogs and RSS Feeds http://www.powerhomebiz.com/onlinemarketing/blogs.htm
I admire for your ambitions to go to college as well as being very responsible on the financial side of things. Please talk to your parents. They will be thrilled to hear all these and do their best so that you can quit your job (at the very least reduce your work load) and concentrate on studies. If your parents need help, they can talk to your school counsellor. You can talk to the school counsellor yourself. I am sure your school and your parents will do whatever they can to help you. If you study well, you will go to college. Don't worry. Things will work out for you. You just need some help from elders now. There are many scholarships and ways of financial aid to go to college. Higher education is your insurance for your long term and happy future. Good luck.
first of all the universe is inside a black hole.\n\nOn a scientific level as i believe in science not god, i make no apologies for my beliefs and you are welcome to your own.\n\nIn the beginning our universe was a star, it imploded and became a black hole, then a giant bounce it turned inside out, so its expanding not contracting as a normal sense of a black hole would. Therefore as we are inside a black hole, you cannot get out of it, nothing can escape the gravitational forces.\n\nAnother weird theory, is we are living in a much bigger item, the sun is one mere neucleus in a atom the planets are electrons around this, the galaxy is the molecules .... its possible just unlikely.\n\nTo get to the other side of the universe in an expanding universe is to stay still, dont move, eventually its edge will meet you.

The balanced reaction is:\nCaC2 + 2H2O ---> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2\n\nThe molar mass of CaC2 is 64 g/mol so you are starting with 0.5 moles of calcium carbide. Since water reactions with CaC2 is a 1:2 ratio, you will need twice as much water, or 1.0 moles of water = 18 grams of water.

well you could talk to him and see what the real problem is. if it has anything to do with their relationship then you could try to work it out between them and if not then just tell them they weren't meant to be together. when my best friend and cousin were dating i was ok with it. we went to a camp-out with a bunch of different churches and they argued the whole time. an old friend of my friend was there and she spent a lot of time with him. my cousin got mad and said that she was cheating on him when she wasn't. i talked about it to both of them and found out that they weren't really happy with each other and they eventually broke-up.

Yes, but it is not the most modern one (there is also SPAS 15, 16). SPAS 12 (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun ) is a Semi/Pump action shotgun. Semi is gas operated, which means quicjer reload withouth having to ue your hand to reload, while the pump action..... well, i'm sure you've seen how pump action shotguns are reloaded. For ammo it uses 12 gauge shells. One more thing- this rifles are used in many law enforcement forces all over the world. If you're interested in shotguns check out Benelli's guns (www.benelliusa.com ).

Working in degrees\n\nUse the equivalence sin(x) + cos(x) = sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45)\n\nYou have 2 * sin(x) = 1 - 2 * cos(x)\nRearrange and divide by 2: sin(x) + cos(x) = 1/2\nThen sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45) = (1/2)\nand thus sin(x + 45) = (1/2) / sqrt(2)\n\nAfter that it boils down to calculator bashing\n\n(1/2) / sqrt(2) = 0.3536\nx + 45 = 20.71 (degrees)\nx = 335.7 degrees\n\nI'll leave you to sort out whether there are other solutions.

As a mountain bike mechanic, I typically recommend this to my customers...\n\nAll bike tires will come with a range listed on the side with hybrids typically being between 60-100 psi. It is important to adjust the tire pressure to the type of terrain you are riding. If you are primarly riding on the road, I would look to inflate the tire to as close to the maximum pressure as possible. This will give you the best surface contact and best speed/acceleration. If you are doing a more rail trail style where you will be on a crushed limestone style path or a packed, unpaved surface, I would recommend deflating to the middle of the range or the upper 3/4 of the range. If you have decided to take the hybrid off road more and choose to ride a more mountain bike style terrain I would use the lower end of the range. \n\nIt is important not to under inflate your tires because the pressure on them could cause the tube to pop or you could experience what is called a pinch flat, where your tire gets stuck between 2 rocks and pops. But also make sure not to inflate the tire beyond capacity because you can pop the tire under too much pressure. But by following the above guidelines, you should be good to go.

The surface of the sun (that which is visible to the naked eye) is roughly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, while the corona has temperatures in the millions of degrees, as does the interior. \n\nEventually, a star of the sun's mass will become a red giant, where it will become cooler (but still plenty hot enough to eventually incinerate at least half of the inner planets of the solar system) and much larger. Then once it has spent its fuel it will collapse into a white dwarf. At this stage it will still be giving off heat and radiation, but no where near the level it does now.
Two things have to happen brutha. They need a scoring winger. An accomplished winger that can just hammer the puck home. Remember the San jose Sharks last season? Cheechoo Thornton, Cheechoo Thornton. It can't happen when you got ECHL'ers like John Madden raping you all game. One line can't do it!\n\nAlso, they need a SOLID Defenseman. Orpik's return will help, but Scudichar have to go. I don't mind Scuderi positionally but look at Carolina's top 6 last playoffs. I honestly think Letang should be up because he is a right hand shot and can get the puck to the net. The Pens have a tendency to keep US born defensemen. Nothing wrong with that but Letang was a perfect replacement for Jackman. Jackman had an absolute rocket. Now all of our defensemen are left-handed shots. Not good for one timers on a PP. Kovalchuk scores all his goals waiting on the left point for one-timers (he is a right handed shot.) We have nobody to put over there to rifle it. \n\n\nTo sum it up I'd say go after Glen Murray. Lose Malone. He is totally disinterested in playing professional hockey. We have to go for this thing now before the salary cap kicks in. Glen Murray straight up (or even Boyes which was rumoured before) for Ryan Malone and a pick and LeClair.!\n\nAs for D? Mark Eaton is a hell of a defenseman. I am surprised -- never seen him play before. We need a Phaneuf style defenseman. I know he is impossible to get. But someone that can impose fear in an offence. Fleury got ran over at least 3 times versus LA the other night and there was no one on the ice to help him out. Cairns is coming back but he is getting like Hatcher - he's not the greatest skater. \n\nRay Shero will figure something out!!

HOW did they steal money? If you lost money, and this went across state lines you can involve the FBI. How do you know they "hacked" your buddies computer? Most likely he had a virus which was a keystroke logger, meaning anything typed was sent to the virus writer. If you logged in then they got your password. Best thign to do is try to log in to your account, when it fails do password recovery since you know the answers, unless they changed them. Then contact yahoo through their help system.
INTERVIEW TIPS\nThese pages are designed to provide you with some useful tips so that you can maximise your success through the application and interview process.\nWhilst this is only a guideline, it is often the simplest of things, which can make the difference between securing the job you want, and being rejected as a possible candidate.\n\nBE PREPARED\n\nIt is often the simple and most obvious things, which can make the difference between securing or losing your ideal job offer. Before the interview there are several things that you can do to give you the leading edge over other applicants. A positive attitude is essential to convince the employer to offer you that lucrative position. \nHere are some helpful hints.\nResearch\nResearch the company in as much detail as you can. Visit the company websites for more detailed information and request a copy of their Annual Report. You can also contact your consultant who will have expert knowledge of the client, the environment you'll be working in, the company culture as well as the employer's expectations and candidate requirements. Take advantage of their experience and they will help you secure your ideal role. \nIt is important to find out specific facts about the company:\n•What its products and services are?\n•What is its growth potential for the future?\n•Who are their main competitors?\n•How are they viewed in the market place?\nThere are a number of research applications providing this information. Among the most helpful are:\n•The company's annual reports\n•Kompass \n•Textline \n•The Stock Exchange Research Handbook \n•The Internet/Company websites \nEnsure that you are up to speed with the facts and figures of your present/former employer. You will be expected to know a lot of information about the company you have previously worked for. \nPresentation\nFirst impressions count. Ensure that you wear your smartest suit and act in a professional manner throughout the interview. A company is more likely to hire somebody who is well presented as they will be future representatives of their company. \nPunctuality\nEnsure that you know the exact time and location of the interview. Your recruitment consultant will provide you with a contact name and also a map of how to get there if required. Allow plenty of time in case of travel delays. \n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW\nInterview Do's \n•Introduce yourself courteously\n•Arrive on time or earlier if possible \n•Express yourself clearly \n•Smile during the interview \n•Show how your experience can benefit the company \n•Ask questions concerning the company for which you are being interviewed for\n•Construct your answers carefully\n•Show willingness to learn and progress \n•Be assertive without being aggressive \n•Switch your mobile off during the interview!\n•Prepare 10 relevant questions, you'll probably cover 5 in the interview \nInterview Don'ts \n•Don't be late for the interview \n•Don't be unprepared for the interview \n•Don't answer questions with a "Yes" or "No". Expand whenever possible \n•Don't lie. Answer all questions truthfully and honestly\n•Don't overemphasise money. Do not discuss salary in the 1st interview unless they do; getting the job at this stage is the main priority - salary negotiations will follow \n•Don't say negative things about previous employers\n•Don't show lack of career planning \nFor every responsibility/requirement on the job specification, ensure you have at least one example of an experience or a transferable skill that covers that requirement for the interview.\nTypical Employer Questions:\nEnsure that you know the exact time and location of the interview. Your recruitment consultant will provide you with a contact name and also a map of how to get there if required. Allow plenty of time in case of travel delays. \nQ: Tell me about yourself?

OMG, if you go by what the gurls say you'll NOT do the right thing at the right time and in the right place. S'ppose I tell you, in all affirmation, that she wanted a kiss from you - oh! you're surprised cos you've not really understood women. One big mistake you're making is that you're revealing your plan for her ahead before making a decision. Women like to be taken unawares. And that's the time they respect you as a "real guy". Let me tell you this (please don't forget), the next time you're with her move close and touch her hair and tell her she's got a fine hair. While doing that, be looking straight into her eyes while talking about some other things but still caressing her hair. The next time she looks at you straight into your eyes, give her a kiss on her lips. You'll be surprised that she'll move close and subconsciously demanding for a deeper one - trust me, it works like magic.

load your pc in safemode. When you reboot your pc continue to press F8 and it will start in safe mode then scan your pc with avast or norton to get rid of it. If that doesnt work then the only other option you have is to reformat your pc which is simple just remember to save your Favorites folder and any other folder and music you wanna keep otherwise they will be gone. Good luck Further question email me page_12001@yahoo.com

Yes I had a similar accident a few years ago, when I put my hamster in the microwave to dry, he came out with the head of bird, it was very confusing and distressing for him as he then believed he was a bird and kept trying to fly....in the end it was the jump of the couch that killed him...it was just too high....I'm still waiting for my replacement head from Bosch.....\nGood luck with your poodle head..
The above poster gave almost the exact answer I stated last time this question was asked. Right click an empty part of the toolbar and click "Customize". On the left under "Available Toolbar Buttons" will be a list of buttons. If you select the back button and click "Add" it will move to the "Current Toolbar Buttons" section. Move it to the top and click Okay and you should be good to go.
I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America. \n But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.\n\n Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.\n\n This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom.\n\n At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.\n\n The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.\n\n Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile--family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head--all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer--not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.\n\n And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.\n\n These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.\n\n They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian stat

Depends on where in the relationship you are...\n\nIf you don't know him, then just go to him and start with hello and talk casually and if you're up to it, flirt...\n\nbut if know him, then tease him/flirt with him crazily so that you BOTH enjoy it and laugh happily. I'm sure he will get the idea that you might be interested in him but would still hesitate. Look for signs he might like you like seeing if he talks abt you w/his friends or if he behaves differently w/u than with other girls and all... Then I suggest you just talk with him about your feelings or if you're shy, etc give him like romantic card or love letter and all...

Piccadilly (pĭk'ədĭl'ē) , street of the City of Westminster borough, London, England. Starting at Piccadilly Circus (London's center of traffic and amusement), it runs to Hyde Park Corner. The street is lined with shops, hotels, and clubs. The Albany, a club, was the residence of T. B. Macaulay, W. E. Gladstone, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Canning.\n\nThe name arises from a tailor named Robert Baker, who owned a shop in The Strand in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling picadils (stiff collars with scalloped edges and a broad laced or perforated border), that were then in fashion. With his great fortune he purchased a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London and in about 1612 he built a large house there. The mansion soon became known as Piccadilly Hall.\n\nThere was a British film made in 1929 called "Piccadilly".\n\n\nPiccadilly is a major London street, running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east. The street is part of the A4 road, London's main western artery, and runs alongside a number of famous buildings and sites, including Green Park.\n\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy and The Ritz Hotel. Simpson, once amongst the nation's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now occupied by the booksellers Waterstones.\n\nThe Piccadilly Line of the London Underground takes its name from Piccadilly and part of the line travels under Piccadilly. Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus tube stations all have entrances either on or near to Piccadilly.\n\n\nPiccadilly (1929) was a British film directed by Ewald André Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Anna May Wong, Gilda Gray and Jameson Thomas. It has been re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration. It appeared in theatres in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005 it was released on DVD.
An eighth note is the note with the flag.\nIn 4:4, 2:4, or 3:4, anything with 4 as the bottom number, it has one-half of a beat (or a count).\nIn any time signature with an 8 on the bottom, an eighth note gets a full count when counting to 8 (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8), one half of a count when counting to 4 (one and two and three and four and).

Neonatal intensive care nurses monitor and maintain the health of critically ill babies who are sent to neonatal intensive care units that are devoted to their care.\n\n\n\nSome babies are born prematurely (under 37 weeks gestation) and they need assistance because various systems and organs are not yet fully developed. Full term babies born with health problems, such as birth defects or infections, may be in the unit because they need special treatment, observation or surgery.\n\nOnce babies are admitted to the NICU, either directly from the delivery room, the newborn nursery, or from another hospital's NICU or nursery, working as part of a specialist team, neonatal intensive care nurses begin the constant monitoring of their young patients. \n\n\n\nWelcome To The NICU \n\nNIC nurses are trained in assessment. They monitor vital signs such as respiration, heart rate and temperature. This information assists the neonatalogist in planning treatment for the baby. \n\nDuring a baby's stay in a NICU, physical examinations and assessments of their condition are regularly carried out by the nurses. To help evaluate a baby's condition, blood, urine tests and x-rays may be arranged and conducted. Weighing and measuring the babies also enables the nurses to keep a check on their progress.\n\n\n\nBabies are monitored from their special beds or incubators, which are used to help keep their body temperature stable. Some may be wrapped in bubble plastic or glad wrap to help keep them warm.\n\nOn The Hour, Every Hour\n\n''NIC nurses do hourly observations, checking the baby's temperature, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure. If the baby is on a ventilator, then the nurse would also maintain the pressure and rate of the ventilator. All of this information, including every abnormality, is recorded,'' says a local neonatal nurse.\n\n\n\n\n\nNIC nurses are taught to be super diligent, they work according to a system and 'cutting corners' is something they simply cannot afford to do. \n\nNIC nurses work under the direction of neonatologists (pediatricians with additional training in newborn intensive care) and they also work closely alongside other NIC nurses, so teamwork is clearly critical in this profession. \n\nAll babies, especially very sick babies, need to be in contact with their parents. NIC nurses encourage a high level of contact between parents and their baby, while the baby is in intensive care. Parents also need to be kept fully informed about their baby's condition. \n\n\n\nNurses need to have very good people and communication skills, and to be supportive of parents with whom they spend a lot of time. It's very much the nurse's responsibility to teach parents how to care for their babies and to look for the signs that indicate something maybe wrong.\n\nVarious sources indicate that much of the pleasure of the job comes from it's very hands on nature, and the satisfaction that comes from getting to know babies and parents, who stay sometimes for a fairly long period of time. But, they also suggest that you need to be able to work in a team, cope with sometimes stressful situations and those irregular hours. \n\nThe development and dissemination of neonatal intensive care technology has been associated with improved survival rates for critically ill, newborn infants, some of whom are born many weeks ahead of their expected birth date.\n\n\n\nIndustry representatives and employment forecasters suggest that employment prospects are good for nurses in general. In Western Australia, there is a strong demand for the skills of NIC nurses but the workforce is still very small. \n\nAfter training, the intensive care nurse can expect to earn about $41,000 per year, which can go as high as $102,000 for a director of nursing.
I don't think that you are alone but I also know that there are many people who claim to be insanely ticklish and LOVE to be tickled to their limits and beyond.\n\nI picked up an a key phrase, "I really hate it sometimes." If I am reading it correctly, you want to be able to enjoy it more but you are so ticklish that it sometimes scares you and sometimes people just take advantage of you and you hate that.\n\nIf there is a person in your life that wants to tickle you and you want to accommodate - you can build up to it and learn to not only take it but also enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nHave him/her massage your feet firm enough were it does not hurt and not soft enough to tickle. Then let him/her GENTLY drag their fingers across your feet. Fight the urge to say "NO" or "STOP". Instead, while you are laughing, say "IT TICKLES!!! IT TICKLES!!!" or "I'M TICKLISH!!! I'm TICKLISH!!!" Soon, you will find yourself enjoying the tickling and taking it longer and longer. If you need an air break, let them know. If they respect you they will give the the air breaks you need.\n\nIf somebody tickles you and you do NOT want them to tickle you, let them know that you find their tickling to be very disrespectful of you and your feelings. If they have a conscience, they will not tickle you again.\n\nI hope that this helped.
Zoe is a great name.

PMS symptoms may be relieved by avoiding caffeine, sugar, salt, white flour, red meat, dairy, butter, monosodium glutamate (MSG), fried foods, and processed foods during the two weeks prior to menstruation. Food that help to fight PMS include steamed green vegetables, salad, beans, grains, and fruit. To obtain essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) women can eat flaxseeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, salmon, mackerel, and tuna.\nA variety of herbal remedies may alleviate symptoms associated with menstrual problems. These include:\n• black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa): mood swings,tension, establishing ovulation (an important source of\nphytoestrogens). The German Commission E, however, states that women should not take black cohosh for menstrual problems for longer than six months because of the risk of side effects.\n• black haw (Viburnum prunifolium): cramps\n• chamomile (Matricaria recutita): mood swings, tension, and cramps\n• cramp bark (Viburnum opulus): cramps\n• dandelion (Taraxacum dang gui): fluid retention and bloating\n• dong quai (Benincasa cerifera): PMS symptoms, cramps, irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, or bleeding in between cycles\n• fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): irregular bowel movements
I've always wondered what all the hype was about too. I always see these new "Chuck Norris Facts" popping up and after a while it just gets old.\n\nMy uncle was a student of his many years ago when Chuck had opened a school in Torrance, CA (my hometown), and I've had some martial arts training myself and would like to pick it up again...but Chuck Norris' face isn't one that comes to my mind when I think of great martial artists or good martial arts movies. Not that he's horrible or anything, I just think he's overrated.

I know this sounds crazy, but it worked for me and everyone else I know. You need to go do your own thing. Immerse yourself in what makes you happy. Try to keep your mind off of finding a boyfriend. Let them come to you. When you do your own thing, you'll meet a guy that has the same interests as you. However, that does not mean to start doing something that doesn't really interest you because you want a new place to find a guy. Do something that honestly interests you. It might not happen right off and it may take a while but it will happen. Also, ask yourself if you need the added stress of a boyfriend and a relationship. Another thing, guys can sense when a girl is feeling desperate. Maybe you are sending off desperate vibes, and they are picking up on that. Boost your self-esteem. Guys like girls with confidence and they also pick up on the fact that you may have low self-esteem. \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean when I was talking about the low-confidence and desperate thing. I was just stating a fact, something you may want to evaluate about yourself.

HE asked YOU out, so he obviously likes you the way you are, and clothes won't make him like you any more / less!\n\nWear something appropriate to the setting (eg. if you're going to a fancy restaurant don't wear track suit pants and a sloppy shirt, but if you're going ice skating don't wear a short skirt and low cut top!)
I don't lie but I don't get into physical characteristics. I like chatting with people etc. because of what they are saying and vis-a-verse. That is what is neat about chatting on line and not in person. You don't feel judged by any flaws that you may have.

No manager will ever outshine Bill "He Made The People Happy" Shankly because what he did was unique...he not only built a successful squad but he built a dynasty that still rules football to this day. The only manager who comes close is the mighty Bob Paisley who took the foundations Bill left him and won a raft of trophys for us. Fergusun, Wenger, Mourinho etc are all talented but they have (a) more money (b) more technology (in terms of fitness etc) and (c) more support. As Bill / God said "Football is not a matter of life and death...it's more important than that".

A few men continue to grow until their late 20s (but not many!) - at 23 it is possible he might still get an extra 1/2 inch or so of height but more likely he has finished growing upwards.\n\nThere are no non-prescription remedies to grow taller short of breaking your leg bones inserting a gap with rods and waiting for the bone to cover the gap! Growth hormone treatment will make you taller prior to the end of your height spurt - after this it will just turn you into a short big foot!!\n\n\nAt 5' 9'' your friend is not short and height is an attitude as well as a physical reality.

No if you prepare every sentence it will look funny. If you plan to do so then please do rehearse so nicely that your dictiona nd your delivery looks absolutely spontaneous.\n\nIf you are a good speaker, just made a structure in points and write down notings about phrases or quotations to be used. It will look very natural and you will also have flexibility to incorporate last minute changes or replies to other peoples point in your delivery. \n\nThats oKay if u made the full speech - in fact it'll make ur life easier. Transfer the key point to a notesheet and try and associate the meat of the sentence into the point!
If it is an isosceles triangle, and you drop a height from the angle between the 14's, then you're creating two right triangles with hypotenuse 14 and one leg 9 (the height bisects the base of the triangle). Using some trig, you can find the base angle. From the point of view of that angle, 9 is an adjacent side, and 14 is a hypotenuse. So,\n\ncos x = 9/14\ncos x = 0.6429\nx = 50 (look it up in a table or use your cos^(-1) function on your calculator)\n\nSo your answer is (a).

The first one to answer had a point, no one really knows if the universe is infinite. But, assuming it is, some one else said that stars dont comprise the most matter in the universe. Only stars make up only 3 percent of the total matter in the universe, dark matter and dark energy comprise about 90 percent of the matter. And remember that stars usually form in clusters (nebulae) to form galaxies. But yeah, no one really knows if the universe is inifinite or not, I mean Voyager 1 and 2 have only just left the gravitational reach of our sun, so we still have a long way to go.

The term sulfide (sulphide in British English) refers to several types of chemical compounds containing sulfur in its lowest oxidation number of −2.\n\nFormally, "sulfide" is the dianion, S2−, which exists in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions formed from H2S or alkali metal salts such as Li2S, Na2S, and K2S. Sulfide is exceptionally basic and, with a pKa > 14, it does not exist in appreciable concentrations even in highly alkaline water. Instead, sulfide combines with protons to form HS−, which is variously called hydrogen sulfide ion, hydrosulfide ion, sulfhydryl ion, or bisulfide ion. At still lower pH's (<7), HS− converts to H2S, hydrogen sulfide. Thus, the exact sulfur species obtained upon dissolving sulfide salts depends on the pH of the final solution.
You need to be under a doctors care. You need to be keeping a daily log of your blood sugar, so you can take it to your visit. They can advise you on a diet and exercise plan to help you learn to deal with diabetes. They can also determine if you need to be on oral medications, insulin or just a proper diet. Do not ignore this problem, because it can damage all of your vital organs if not controlled.

The Apocalypse Of Saint John\n Chapter 22\n\n16 I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the bright and morning star. 17 And the spirit and the bride say: Come. And he that heareth, let him say: Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will, let him take the water of life, freely. 18 For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book. 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book. 20 He that giveth testimony of these things, saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. \n\n21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Hailstones do cause injury if they're large enough.\n\nSmaller ones are less harmful. The reason lies in the density and air resistance difference between a penny and a hailstone.\n\nA penny weighs about 3 grams. A comparable hailstone would have to be at least .75 inches in diameter to be comparable in mass, and will have more wind resistance as it falls. \n\nCheck out this link regarding hailstone injury

The chalk dries the sweat and moisture from the hand and offers a better grip. It is the same reason gymnasts use chalk.
When I look at problems like these, I use the two-point formula. Since y is decreasing by a constant amount each time, it's ok to use the two-point formula. Basically, you choose two points...I'll choose (0,1) and (1,-8). Then, you calculate the slope, which is (y2-y1) / (x2-x1). It doesn't really matter which y or x comes first as long as they are correspondent with each other. So, the slope would be (-8-1) / (1-0), which is -9/1, which is -9. Then, plug it back into the equation y = mx + b. So, I'll use the point (0,1). 1 = -9(0) + b. 1 = 0 + b. b = 1. As a result, the function is...y = -9x + 1

Here is the famous astronomer late. Dr. Carl Sagan's answer to similar question. I found it in Nova website. Below is the paragraph extracted from that website.\n\n"First of all, it might be that you can build a time machine to go into the future, but not into the past, and we don't know about it because we haven't yet invented that time machine. Secondly, it might be that time travel into the past is possible, but they haven't gotten to our time yet, they're very far in the future and the further back in time you go, the more expensive it is. Thirdly, maybe backward time travel is possible, but only up to the moment that time travel is invented. We haven't invented it yet, so they can't come to us. They can come to as far back as whatever it would be, say A.D. 2300, but not further back in time. \nThen there's the possibility that they're here alright, but we don't see them. They have perfect invisibility cloaks or something. If they have such highly developed technology, then why not? Then there's the possibility that they're here and we do see them, but we call them something else—UFOs or ghosts or hobgoblins or fairies or something like that. Finally, there's the possibility that time travel is perfectly possible, but it requires a great advance in our technology, and human civilization will destroy itself before time travelers invent it." -Carl Sagan

no... proper diet.. oxy pads.. careful cleansing of your face using non drying creams... drinking water and sweating work much better than this expensive product.\n\nmost products that you must apply to the face clog pores.\n\nuse oxy and do drink more water.. stay away from foods that have to much chemicals... \n\nexercise with much perspiration is a great way to clean the pores.. of course using a dry towel and wiping in circular motions... and showering afterwards does help and is much cheaper.\n\nand works better.\n\nafter steam cleaning a face use again a dry towel and wipe in circular motions.
There are two factors to understand difference and similarities in humans. First is HEREDITY, every person inherited some of his characteristics from the parents, on the ratio of 4:1. This kind of characteristics can never be changed cause it is in the genes that makes you genetically similar to either your father or mother. This characteristics cannot be modified and are observed in the color of eyes; shape of the body, fingers, face; size of chest. Second is ENVIRONMENT, every person is also a product of environmental condition. This characteristics are the ones that can be modified externally. The color of your skin may change thru climatic condition, surgery, intake of chlorinated water; color of hair can change by exposure to salt water in the shore at all times, dye and etc.

I would love, love, LOVE to play Hermione in the Harry Potter movies. I think that her role would be so much fun, since she is one of the only girls amidst all of those boys(yay for guys), and also since she is so smart. And of course, because she gets to use magic and go on adventures! Going to Hogwarts would be so cool. I just think that she would be such a great person to be. Good question, by the way!
the taste and smell of sperm relates to what you eat and go with your body like you said. Healthy sperm does have a more distinct flavor than toxic sperm. They do make pills you can get on the net that are highly concentrated fruit poweder, so your man's cum, if he eats the pilss 2 hours before sex, can tast like bannana or oranges. You can also eat lots of those fruits and your cum will taste sweet and smell good.

Strings have sound because they vibrate in harmonic waves. The length of those waves, or "wavelengths" is one factor that affects how the sound will behave.\n\nSince both ends of the string are fixed tight, the waves are forced to begin and end in a definite space. This forces the wavelengths into lengths that are dependant on one wave starting and finishing from one end of the string to the other. Since different string lengths will produce different wavelengths, the sound will behave differently. \n\nThe other main factor that affects sound is tension. The tighter the string, the shorter the wave will be. A short wave height, or "amplitude" causes the wave to move faster, which produces a higher pitch.\n\nSo, you have wavelength and amplitude. Those two things could take up a whole semester of physics, but they're relatively simple concepts. (Unless you play trumpet)

The bowling ball. Since you were not specific in how you were going to get 25,000 feet above the ground, I am going to assume that you are on top of the Pacific Ocean. The ball will sink into the depths around the Marianis Trench and hit the ground some 4 1/2 miles underwater. The pencil will float on the surface until it gets waterlogged. It may sink but it will be much later than the ball.\n\nWhat will those fish do with a bowling ball anyway? Bowling pins will float.

Most substances expand when heated. Water is the only exception because of it's hydrogen bonds (with oxygen). Diesel fuel is composed of mostly straight chain hydrocarbons with relatively low boiling points meaning they are not very attracted to each other and are likely to spread out when heated.

Canara bank is also an option other than SBI. Vijaya Banks also extend vidyarthi loans. Be sure to take the loan only from a public sector bank and not a private one. While applying for a loan, students can include hostel expenses, the cost of books, equipment, and examination fees in the loan amount. Students going abroad can also include airfare. Loan limit. Nationalised banks sanction student loans up to Rs 3-5 lakh. This is higher for studies abroad-for instance, Canara Bank offers loans of up to Rs 10 lakh. \n\n\n* Banks only disburse loans to account holders in the same bank. \n* Loans have to be backed with 100 per cent collateral in the form of immovable property or a mix of securities. \n* Banks may ask for more than 100 per cent collateral, but students are not obliged to give more. \n* The chances of getting a student loan are lower if the parent/guardian is retired and does not have a steady source of income. This is because the bank has to be paid interest during the period of study. The bank could ask for a personal guarantee from a third party. \n* The bank disburses the loan amount directly to the institute a student is admitted in. \n* Students have to provide the bank with mark sheets every semester/ year to show their progress through the course. \n\nMost nationalised banks sanction loans at the branch level, which means that the loan is usually disbursed in about 3-4 weeks. But if there is even a slight deviation from the norm-as defined by the bank -- in the course applied for and the mix of collateral, the loan may have to be cleared at a higher level.\n\nall the best
In the US, you have more rights than duties. In general the US was founded upon the idea that anything not specifically given to government was retained by the citizens.\n\nYou list three disimilar situations. \n\n1 "To say something 2 some1 who parks in a handicap space & the person is not handicap."\n\nIn my community a city police car on a non-emergency situation was ticketed by the State Police. This was in accordance with the law. It was done more as a publicity stunt than anything else, but it showed the community reaction to the situation.\n\n2) "To say something to a parent who spanks or yell at they;re child or kids in public"\n\nYou have an right for saying something in a non-hostile way if you just don't like it. You have a duty if you feel it is abusive and harmful. Better be willing to go to court to back it up though, because among 300,000,000 people there are wide variations regarding what is abusive and harmful and what is not.\n\n3) "To say something to a mother who's nursing her baby in public"\n\nAgain, you have the right..... but what do you want to say? There is in itself nothing wrong with this action and a lot to recommend it if done in a demure and careful manner. You certainly don't have any duty here. It's considered healthy and medically recommended. Most women would prefer to do it in private but when privacy is not available it is not shameful. \n\nAnd you said "or do I shutup & look the other way or mind my own business?"\n\nI wouldn't say to do that. What I suggest is that you pay attention, develop an informed and researched opinion, avoid expressing hostility by developing tact, and talk and observe enough to know the variations between your family's and your communities values and the values of the larger world. Then..... think about it and make your own unprejudiced decisions. The world is your business. You can choose to be part of it, or to judge it.

1) x^2 - 4 \nThis is a problem called the difference of squares. They are presented in the form of (a)^2 - (b)^2. A difference of squares problem always factors to (a+b)(a-b).\nIn this case, a = x and b^2 = 4. sqrt(4) = 2, so b=2.\nPlug it in to your algorithm, an you have (x+2)*(x-2)\n\n2) 4x^2 - 9\nAnother difference of squares. As a starter, sqrt(4x^2) = 2x, and sqrt(9) = 3. \n\n3) x^2 + 8x + 16\nNow for something completely different. The following is a true statement.\n(Ax + B)(Cx + D) = (AC)x^2 + (BC)x + (DA)x + (BD)\nSo, if this will factor, you need to find A, B, C, and D so that AC = 1, BD = 16, and BC+DA = 8. [The last one is true because of the distributive property of multiplication, in other words "xz + yz = (x+y)z" ] \nThe first assumption we are going to make is that because AC = 1; A = 1 and C = 1. This won't always be true, and if we can't find something to match the others, we can always go back and change that assumption. We do this because it's the easiest to work with. Since A=1 and C=1, then we can rewrite "BC + DA = 8" as "B+D=8".\nNow, go back to when you learned to multiply signed numbers. The only way you can have a positive number as a product is when both multipliers are the same sign. Now, go back farther to adding signed numbers and remember that a negative plus a negative is always going to be a negative. Since "BD" is positive and "B+D" is positive, then both B and D are positive. In fact, the only two numbers that fulfill both statements are B=4, D=4 (If that jump's too great for you, factor 16 and you get 2*2*2*2. That means your choices for pairs are 2,8 (adds to 10, so wrong); 1,16 (17); and 4,4 (8).)\nSo, when we plug our numbers back into that statement a few dozen lines ago, we get the factoring of \n(x+4)*(x+4), or (x+4)^2\n\n4) 4(x^2) + 4x + 1\nOK, this is the same deal. (ax+b)(cx+d)=ac(x^2)+adx+bcx+bd\nSo, "bd=1", "ad+bc=4", and "ac=4"\nSince we have another product of 1; assume, for a minute, that "b=1", "d=1". That means "a+c=4" and "ac=4". Again, both product and sum are positive, so both "a" and "c" are positive. Factor 4, and you get 2*2. So your choices are 1,4 (sum of 5); and 2,2 (4). So, plug back in and you get\n(2x+1)(2x+1) or (2x+1)^2\n\n5) 2d^2 - 18.\nThis one is a tricky one. You can't do the difference of squares, because sqrt(2) and sqrt(18) are both irrational. But there is something you can factor out....\nRight, factor out a two and you have\n(2)(d^2-9) or (2)(d^2 - 3^2)\nNow, you have a difference of squares, and can easily get the answer.\n(2)(d+3)(d-3)
Anyone who knows me, knows to never, ever say anything derogatory about these young men and women in my presence, regardless of how they feel about the war. They are my brothers and sisters. Yes, there have been abuses and errors, and those need to be investigated and any violators appropriately punished. But by far the vast majority of our military personnel are professional, dedicated and just. \n\nEveryone dies eventually, but some get to die fighting for something in which they believe. To detract from this honorable death by saying they "died for nothing" is, IMHO, virtually unforgiveable. Does the person who dies in a hospital bed from some incurable disease "die for nothing?"

Mr. Mister had it almost right!\n\nHe said\n>No. She is not a virgin anymore.\n\n>She was single and gave birth to Jesus. after >the birth, her and Joseph got married and had >kids.\n\n>Jesus does have 1/2 brothers. 1/2 sisters as >we know them. Thats right.\n\nActually, Joseph did marry Mary and they went to pay taxes in another town called Bethlehem. That is where Jesus was born. After Jesus was born the Bible clearly tells us that Mary had other children. People do not realize it is there, because it is not a religious point that ministers preach on, and most people do not read their own Bibles! However, it stated that she had other children. \n\nShe was not a virgin after Jesus, but she was a virgin when Jesus was born. However, to give her that title is not really wrong, but an acknowledgment and declaration of her being a virgin at the time of Jesus birth.

Fear of exams is actually a very common problem among school-age children. First, it's a good idea to make certain that the fear is not brought on by a learning problem or disability. For example, some children do very poorly on exams because they read slowly or with great difficulty. They can do the regular homework well because they work very hard and are bright. But in a timed test situation, they can't keep up. One hint of this is a child who answers the first half of the test questions correctly, but doesn't get to the second half of the questions at all (and thus earns a very low score). \n\nTest-taking anxiety is often easy to deal with using relaxation and mental imagery techniques. With a little coaching, most children quickly learn to think pleasant, restful thoughts and enjoy the feeling of their bodies relaxing. They can then give themselves instructions to feel calm and relaxed during tests. Somehow, the body remembers, and they do in fact feel calmer during tests. Many child psychologists and pediatricians are skilled in teaching children relaxation. Some call this process self hypnosis, but I think that makes it sound more mysterious than it really is.

Contact the bankruptcy court in your area and they should have an automated voicemail service that will tell you if someone has filed using their name, case #, and/or social security #. It won't tell you a lot of details but it will confirm if they filed or not.
Check once the contract with your ISP. I bet you can read somewhere "best effort", so these 6mbps are are theoretical value. And keep in mind, not many servers in the internet can provide that speed.
here's the thing emotional infidelity is just as bad as sexual infidelity.....you did say you are married right? what will your wife feel if she accidentally walks in and finds you exchanging emails with someone who you're having an affair with.....trust is something that is so easy to break but so hard to earn.

Yes and no. There has been a 'west vs. islam' battle going on for well over a thousand years predating even the crusades. The current 'war on terror' is really a return to this ancient battle of cultures. The only time that this was not in the forefront was the 80 some-odd years of fighting against communism.\n\nI pretty much agree with you and have been saying this to people since I watched the towers come down from my office in Manhattan.

Check on anything that you have installed recently. Norton Antivirus suddenly made my CD drives vanish a few years ago so I had to uninstall it and stop using it and then all was fine. Some software like that can cause them to vanish. Try uninstalling recent software and see if that helps. If your drive has power - drawer opens etc then it should be recognised even if it won't read a CD. Try a system restore to before you had this problem and all should be well.

a teddy bear, they are adorable and people cuddle them, however if you are a snoopy doll, you might be a collectable and just sit there on the shelf, waiting for your day, watching the furry lovable, teddy bear get cuddled while you collect dust, sure maybe an ooohh or ahhh every once in a great while from a fan, but where is the deal love. The hug tight at night, the being drooled on and rolled over on when they fall asleep... Then as a Snoopy you sit, angry, bitter, but unable not to smile, until one day your rage and jealousy of the teddy bear take hold, and then... i don't want to be that teddy bear. So my answer is, i would prefer to be a teddy bear, unless there was a snoopy collectable in the house.

I know the feeling but it sounds to me that you are taking way to much of the xanax and is probably prescibed by a family doctor and not one that you should be seeing not saying you are crazy i have these attcaks all the time and going off your meds will only make them worst but you may need a stabilizer and a diffrent approach to treatment. and when you say you are not feeling good i wonder what exactly that means do you have some depression going on? again nothing to be ashamed of just asking . I wish you luck and dont give up on yourself just try to understand what is going on to make you feel this way in the first way

Technically, anything with mass has gravity and there is no limit to gravity's range, but the affect on the earth is astronomically (pardon the pun) small and may be beyond our ability to detect.\nThat being said, there is another thing that massive object can do, and that is that they can act as a "gravitational lens". We may be able to "see" another galaxy or object that is behind the irregular galaxy simple because the mass of the galaxy bends space to the point that the light from the other object bends around it and we can then see it. This phenomenon has been observed on a small scale, and its effect can be caused by any massive object, not just an irregular galaxy.
Republicans are more pro-business than Democrats, and the airwaves and the media is increasingly controlled by big business. It's easy for people on the left to complain about conservative bias and for the people on the right to complain about the liberal media, but just follow the money.\n\nAfter Reagan signed a bill removing the airwaves from the public domain, you have seen an aggressive and successful wave of business-controlled media. This is not a left/right issue as much as a public domain/business issue.\n\nAnd Republicans are more supported by business.

In the beginning Man created God;\nand in the image of Man\ncreated he him.\n\n2 And Man gave unto God a multitude of\nnames,that he might be Lord of all\nthe earth when it was suited to Man\n\n3 And on the seven millionth\nday Man rested and did lean\nheavily on his God and saw that\nit was good.\n\n4 And Man formed Aqualung of\nthe dust of the ground, and a\nhost of others likened unto his kind.\n\n5 And these lesser men were cast into the\nvoid; And some were burned, and some were\nput apart from their kind.\n\n6 And Man became the God that he had\ncreated and with his miracles did\nrule over all the earth.\n\n7 But as all these things\ncame to pass, the Spirit that did\ncause man to create his God\nlived on within all men: even\nwithin Aqualung.\n\n8 And man saw it not.\n\n9 But for Christ's sake he'd\nbetter start looking.
Do the matrix vector multiplication and demand AX=0. Then\n1x - 1y - 2z = 0 (eq.1)\n2x - 2y - 4z = 0 (eq.2)\n3x - 3y - 4z = 0\nThe first and last equations are identical. So you have only two equations.\nFrom (1) x = y + 2z gives in (2)\n2(y + 2z) -2y - 4z = 0\nThis is true for all y and z.\nNow the solution is X = [y + 2z . y, z]\nin which y and z can be chosen as you like it.

I've almost drowned twice, and it is definitely no like being let free. On the other hand, it isn't agony either. It's more like pure terror. You fight to get to the surface, or get out from under something which is what happened in both of my cases. Your head starts pounding and your vision starts fading. It doesn't really hurt, it's just like holding your breath for too long, then u take a breath and water fills your lungs. When you break the surface though, it's like being re-born. That first breath is amazing and is the best feeling in the world. So yea, drowning is more terror than anything.

Lots of saline nasal spray, like Ocean brand. You may be too dry to let things drain. Also try breathing in steam through the nose or use humidifier. \nOn the other hand, if you have lots of drainage try Sudafed Non-Drying. For the headache part if severe, try Motin/Advil. A warm towel from the microwave may help any facial pain. Drinks LOTS of water and be stingy on the amount of dairy, as dairy thinkens the mucus. And sleep on 2 pillows and that may keep you from getting too blocked up. Good Luck to you! :) I hope you feel better real soon!

Energy (that includes light) can change form. When light hits a black object for example, the atoms of the object absorb the light, then radiate it back off at a longer wavelength (we feel this as heat). Plants collect light using their leaves and convert it into chemical energy (food for the plant). Photocells convert light to electricity.

As far as I ever learned, they are two words meaning the same thing, synonyms. \n\nMorality refers to the concept of human ethics which pertains to matters of good and evil —also referred to as "right or wrong", used within three contexts: individual conscience; systems of principles and judgments — sometimes called moral values —shared within a cultural, religious, secular, Humanist, or philosophical community; and codes of behavior or conduct.\n\nThe field of ethics, also called moral philosophy, involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Philosophers today usually divide ethical theories into three general subject areas: meta ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.

I am a type two diabetic, and my blood sugar was 540 the first time they took it. Although, 183 is high, that can be controlled by what you eat. If you cut the sugar out of most of what you eat it would be a good thing. I mean the sugar you add yourself, as everything you eat has sugar in it. And you need to watch your carbohydrates. \n\nLook on any can or box and it will tell you the carbohydrates in a serving. I was told that I could have 45 carbohydrates per meal and 15 for each snack, only 3 snacks a day. Carbohydrates turn to sugar in your system.\n\nThis may help your blood sugar, but the wisest advice I can give is to see a doctor, I do not like to see them either, but had I not gone to one, I might have died from mine, and it is always better to know. They can prescribe medicene in pill form to help keep your blood sugar low.\n\nGood luck to you.

It looks like you're referring to broadband connections. A simple answer to your question won't be exact, since there are many variables. A low-end Digital Subscriber Link Like I used to have (Qwest) advertised 256K download speeds, but provided as little as 60-156k download speeds. When I called their tech support, the guy said, "Oh, you never get the advertised speed." There are faster DSL providers, but they charge more. A cable broadband service (like mine....Comcast) advertises much higher speeds than it actually delivers. I get between 1 meg and 3 meg download speeds, when the advertised speed is more than double my average download speed. With cable, the connection is shared with others in your neighborhood, so the speed goes down when more people are on line. With DSL, your speed will be fairly stable, but much lower on the average.

My guess would be not, but what I would do would be to research for any studies linking Agent Orange to physical harm in humans.

Good luck sir.
Because when it came out, there was nothing new and fresh that got children involved more in wanting to read and it filled that gap. It engages kids into using their imaginations more. It takes adults back to their younger years with the fantasy of it all. It's a good series that keeps growing and developing. Even though we've know from the begining that there would be only 7 books and ultimately a showdown between Harry & Voldemort, it's still interesting to see the unexpected twists and turns on the way to the end. It's just a GREAT series!

Author's note to The Thief \n\nNothing in The Thief is historically accurate, but I have taken bits and pieces out of the history of Greece and fitted them into my story. The landscape that Gen travels through is very much like that of ancient Greece and like some parts of modern Greece as well. The gods he meets were never the gods of the Greek Pantheon. There was a god of fire, Hephestus, who became the Roman god Vulcan and gave his name to Volcanoes. I changed the name to Hephestia and used it for my ruling goddess, and called the volcanoes the Hephestial Mountains, but my goddess and the Greek god really don't have much in common. He was the jealous husband of Aphrodite and was always low in the hierarchy of the gods. \n\nWhether Moira was a Greek god is a fuzzier question. Her name means "Fate" and she was sometimes personified as the messenger of the three fates who were spinning and weaving the fate of the world. Sometimes she was one of the fates, but she was never described as she is in The Thief. Asklepios, to whom the palace physician swore an oath to use his powers for healing, is another mythic figure. He was supposed to have been the son of Apollo and a mortal princess. He was educated by the centaur Cheiron and was skillful enough to resuscitate the dead. Hades and Zeus were anxious to keep the power of the gods for the gods alone and Zeus sent a thunderbolt to strike Asklepios and kill him. Nonetheless, he became the god of medicine and was pictured carrying a staff with a magic serpent wrapped around it, and this is now a symbol for doctors all over the world. \n\nArchimedes was real. He was a mathematician, mechanic, and physicist in the third century b.c His work survives to this day. One of his theories was that a constant amount of water must pass each point in a river in a fixed amount of time. Therefore the water in a river runs fastest at its narrowest point. Gen had this in mind when he and the magus and Athonis crossed the rapids of the Seperchia. \n\nAncient Greece had many more trees and better soil than modern Greece has. Thousands of years ago the forests were logged and the soil eroded, leaving much of Greece rocky, but even in the poor soil, olive trees thrive. Between the shore of the Corinthian Gulf and the ancient site of the Oracle at Delphi there are eleven miles of olive groves, called the sea of olives. There isn't, as far as I know, anything like the dystopia. \n\nIn the city of Sounis that I described there were once walls that defended the road between the city and its harbor. The city of Athens in Greece had walls like these. Stones from these walls were used to build various parts of the city, but there are still signs of them today, something like two thousand years after they were built. There is a lion gate like the one in Sounis, in the ruins of the city of Mycenae which was real. Meneleus was king of Mycenae. Helen of Troy was abducted from there. Its ruins are on the eastern most peninsula of the Peloponnese, that little hand-shaped piece of land attached to the mainland of Greece. The gate is just as described by the thief. Carved into a solid stone lintel, most of the detail has worn away and it is impossible to tell if the figures are really lions. They may have been griffins like those I mentioned on either side of the Eddissian throne. Those griffins are like the ones painted on the walls beside the throne in the palace of Knossos on the island Crete. The walls of Knossos were also decorated with paintings of swallows and lilies and a mural called the Great Procession. The civilization that built that palace was older than the one at Mycenae. It was obliterated, some people think by a volcano erupting in the Mediterranean around fourteen fifty b.c. The ruins of its many many rooms may have been the source of the myth of the Minotaur and the maze. \n\nThe megaron at Mycenae was nowhere near as elaborate as Knossos. It was just a single room with stone

That's the part where the new nail is growing- underneath the existing nail. It is white, because it is not laying against the skin, as the rest of the nail is. The skin has blood vessels under it, which tint the skin pink, which is why that part of the nail is pink. If you notice, the end of the nail is white, too, because that is no longer laying on skin.

Repect... Christians values... Just shows what some people really are.
It is obvious, AnxiusVigilans , that your hostility toward Christianity, coupled with your long list of questions regarding everyone elses beliefs, that you believe you can cast doubt on any believer so they may become a professional skeptic like yourself.\nYour defensive posturing indicates your fear of being wrong, and afraid God may exist, and we'll be in His presence in paradise forever, and your slanted dismissal of Gods existence will lead you to agonizing eternal punishment. I pray you'll stop being so defensive and dismissive.

there is a technique of self examining your breast for any mass ...mass feeling is the best sign for a breast cancer ..however i must tell you that a mass might not be a cancer but ratherly a benign lesion...( some doctors advice their patients to remove it so it might not change into malignancy ) ..there is other signs concerning the mass & doctors take it into consideration when they are physically examining their patients such as ..the size of the mass .. is it adherant to overlying tissues ..is adherent to the skin .. how does the skin over the mass looks like .. they also look for the nipple & ask if any changes occured to it such as inverting inside the breast tissue\n\neven if not totally true but if the mass is small its better & its more likely to be benign \nif the mass is adherent to the breast tissues or to skin over it its more likely to be malignant \nif the skin over the mass has changed in colour & became grey to orange in colour its more likely the mass is cancerous \nif the nipple was inverted inside ( a new change & not born with this feature ) then its more likely that its a breast cancer \nsome of these signs are more dangerous than others such the changes in the skin & nipple because they indicate a high grade cancer lesion \nif you have felt a mass under your fingers when self examinning urself its better to go to a doctor as soon as possible because if it a cancer breast & still a low grade you can remove it before the cancer metastasize into other tissues & organs

It's better to make money before you move than to move without money, so I'd recommend taking two jobs for the rest of the time you're in Orlando. Not only will your bank account grow, but you'll spend a lot of time away from the home, which leaves you less time to fight with your ex. Also look at what you are planning to bring on the move with you; household items like dishes and furniture can often be more expensive to move than to replace when you are settled in. Sell everything you don't absolutely need to bring with you; you may not become rich off of a yard sale but you'll have some more cash and less stuff which makes for easier travel.\n\nIf your goal is to simply be closer to your daughter rather than live with her in NJ, look into Delaware, especially the Wilmington area, for a place to live. Wilmington is experiencing a great phase of growth right now so you may earn more there than you expect, and the cost of living is still fairly reasonable. It's just about an hour or so on the Amtrak from Wilmington to NYC so it's pretty close to NJ.

If your question is the same as the other one, then there is something your friend can do. Most "head shops" carry drinks that are specifically formulated to clean your body of any trace of marijuana. I've never smoked the stuff myself, but I have friends who have passed drug tests only a day or two after smoking because of the system-cleaning drinks they bought at head shops. Wish your friend luck for me.

Wow, you really messed up typing. Might try the space bar next time. :-D\n\nAnyway, I think you're asking, "Find out the [longitude] of a place Q where [the] local time is 10:30 AM, while the local time of another place P, situated at 40 degrees [longitude], is 2 PM."\n\nSo you know that the earth has 360 degrees of longitude (you go the whole way around and you cover a circle). You also know that if you go the whole way around the world, you'll pass through every time. So you have 24 hours.\n\nProportion: 24 hours = 360 degrees\n\nThe difference between the two times (10:30 AM and 2 PM) is 3 hours and 30 minutes, or 3.5 hours.\n\nProportion: 3.5 hours = ? degrees\n\n24 / 3.5 = 360 / x\nCross-multiply:\n24 * x = 3.5 * 360\nx = 3.5 * 360 / 24 = 52.5\n\nProportion: 3.5 hours = 52.5 degrees\n\nSo we know that the change in longitude is 52.5 degrees. Now the question is whether to add or subtract that from 40 degrees, which we know is the original (P). From P to Q, we're going backwards in time, which we know is westwards (look at time zones, or think about TV ads that say that a show is airing at 8 eastern, 7 central). So we need to move 52.5 degrees west. If your 40 degrees is already 40 W, then add +52.5 W to get 92.5 W. But if it's 40 E, then you need to move in the opposite direction. 40 - 52.5 = -12.5 E, or 12.5 W.

Since you have not provided much info, it limits the answers you could be given. It could be that you are shy and speaking to people is difficult. The other thing that comes to mind is that you are insecure and have poor self esteem. It just makes you not sure enough of yourself and you are fearful of saying the wrong things or in the wrong way. You probably need to read some books like, 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'. You may also need to get some counseling on developing your self esteem. Good luck to you in your search!

Interesting question. Republicans, in principle cherish small government and the freedom to expand economic activity.They will respect the citizen who is contributing to the economy, no matter what race he or she belongs to.\nDemocrats cherish big government and the idea of creating and maintaing a population dependent on the government.\nIn different ways, both Republicans and Democrats can be seen as racists.\nThere is another group much more dangerous than racists; the liberals. They discriminate against their own country

You are right, totally... It is an absolute disregard for the environment.\n\nThe Bush administration in 2003 effectively gutted the ‘no net loss’ of wetlands policy initiated during the administration of the elder Bush. Wetlands help reduce the power of hurricanes and storm surges. Wetlands were largely missing when Katrina struck, and contributed to the devastating effects of that so-called antural disaster...\n\nLets see - destroy the wetlands, don't fix the levees, duh... that is almost as obvious as - "I think the memo said something like Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S" \n\nWe need to change - \n\nWe must transform human social relations so that production (and the technology accompanying it) develops in a planned manner that takes into account human need and, by extension, the care of the natural environment upon which human needs depend.\n\nciao
Now you said that the two of you are doing hurtful things to each other. Then the two of you need to remember why you got married in the first place. Figure out what you want your marriage to be and make changes. Consult the bible, it clearly outlines the role of the wife as well as the husband.\n As a spouse you should be his best friend and vise versa, but this can't happen if the two of you aren't giving each other the respect that the other deserves. Just remember communication is the key to a sucessful marriage.

When you buy an exotic animal, you will not know how to properly care for it. It will cause problems in your life because it doesn't belong in your house. And you will probably be the cause of its death because of your selfish decision.

No it was yet another way to make money on booze and advetising. Sort of like the commercialized holiday we celebrate as Christmas which has now nothing to do with the real meaning.
they most likely mean nothing. This appears to be one of many heretical documents created during the reign of THeospacy in England. Since many of the documents were formed by the process of 'ghost writing' (relying on spritual impulses or dreams to form content) random infomration can appear more significant than intended.\n\n-Intresting note: SOme of the names have been changed from the orginal document, according to the footnotes, based on further 'translation' of the heavenly language. It would appear that the names are suppose to have meaning in the language of 'heaven' which some teoshpists and today's new-agers belive would give them mystic power if they could learn to speak it.
Renegotiate, get the deal back.
what do you need this for?\n\nBackground: The word emphysema is derived from Greek and means "to blow into," hence "air containing" or "air inflated." The term emphysema was initially applied to air within the tissues (ie, subcutaneous emphysema). In 1721, Ruysch described large air spaces in lung specimens of humans as emphysema. In 1799, Matthew Bailey subsequently provided the first clear illustration and description of emphysema as enlarged air spaces. Laennec contributed considerably to the understanding of emphysema and recognized that emphysema is associated with chronic bronchitis. In 1939, Cournand introduced the notion that emphysema causes airflow obstruction.\n\nEmphysema is defined as abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of the walls and without obvious fibrosis. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal.\n\nThe first type, centriacinar emphysema, begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also called centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs.\n\nThe second type is panacinar emphysema, which destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. This type of emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema.\n\nThe third type, distal acinar emphysema (also known as paraseptal emphysema), preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue.\n\nPathophysiology: Emphysema commonly presents with chronic bronchitis, and the pathological changes occur not only in the lung parenchyma but also in the large and small airways. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by mucous gland enlargement, focal squamous metaplasia, ciliary abnormalities, variable amounts of airway smooth muscle hyperplasia, inflammation, and bronchial wall thickening. The respiratory bronchioles display a mononuclear inflammatory process, lumen occlusion by mucus plugging, goblet cell metaplasia, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and distortion due to fibrosis. These changes, combined with loss of supporting alveolar attachments, cause airflow limitation by allowing airway walls to deform and narrow the airway lumen.\n\nEmphysema, on the other hand, is characterized by focal destruction limited to the airspaces distal to the respiratory bronchioles. Both emphysematous destruction and small airway inflammation often are found in combination in individual patients. When emphysema is moderate or severe, loss of elastic recoil, rather than bronchiolar disease, is the mechanism of airflow limitation. By contrast, when emphysema is mild, bronchiolar abnormalities are most responsible for the airflow limitation. Although air flow obstruction in emphysema is virtually irreversible, bronchoconstriction due to inflammation accounts for a limited amount of reversibility.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nPathologically, various lesions may be found in the airways of emphysematous lungs. Some are the lesions of chronic bronchitis; others affect the small airways. The vascular changes develop simultaneously. Abnormal longitudinal muscle appears in the intima of arterioles and arteries; these may show intimal fibrosis and thickening of the muscular media. Enlargement of bronchial arteries and veins occurs in some patients. Bronchial venous enlargement may cause shunting of systemic venous blood to the left atrium.\n\nCigarette smoking\n\nCigarette smoking leads to neu
There is scientific proof that there was a large flood in Noah's part of the world. What I find interesting is that in an ancient manuscript, called "The Epic of Gilgamesh", the main character, aforementioned, spoke of a great flood, just like Noah's, and fleeing with his family and many animals in a boat. What's even more interesting was that this manuscript was written 1500 years before Noah's account was written. \nThis just shows how a catastrophic event passed down, by word of mouth, to many generations. It's probably unlikely that a flood covered the entire earth, because when the Bible mentions the world, the actual known world at that time was a tiny spot in the Mesopotamia region. That could have been flooded entirely, who knows?\nI am also Catholic...

Yes...if a player is injured during his at bat (ie: fouling a ball off of his body resulting in broken bones or getting a major muscle strain where he just can't swing/stand the pain) It happened to Jermaine Dye when he was with Oakland. They were playing the Yankees at Yankee Stadium and he fouled a ball off of his leg and shattered the bone below the knee. Dye was carried off of the field by 2 players. The batter who replaced him inherited his count. I think it may have been a playoff game and El Duque was pitching (not positive about this).
It depends on what type of insurance you're looking for. I guessing in this case you mean medical insurance. There are a ton of medical insurance providers and basically what it comes down to is what you need that service to provide.

For a list of insurance providers look at the links below. There is a link specifically for stundents.

Our heart is myogenic. That is it can beat on its own. If you take out your heart and put it in a solution with the right concentration of sodium, potassium and calcium, it can still beat. This is because, there are a group of cells known as the pacemakers in the SAN,AVN and Purkinjie fibres. They auto depolarise and start an electtrical impulse that travels down a certain pathway so that the 2 atria contracts before the 2 ventricles. \n\nHowever the rate of heart beat is controlled by the medulla of the brain. It either speeds up (sympathetic) or slows down (parasympathetic via vagus and glossopharyngeal) depending on the needs of the body.

I would suggest seeing a family physician. I have had months on end of headaches. I have tried migraine medication that didn't work. Eventually a neurologist had commented that mine are from neck and shoulder tension. Using too many pills over time can make headaches worse. Try looking at medical websites to determine if you are suffering from migraines or tension headaches. Once you figure that out, it is easier to learn how how to treat them. Hope it isn't migraine because some of the medication is awfully expensive ($100 for 6 pills). Because headaches can be a sign of brain tumors, it isn't something you want to take lightly. Don't wait.

Marie,\nI WISH in the real world it were possible to have things the way you say. But I think that even if people were all independent, that would not change how people feel about the two extreme worldviews of liberals/conservatives and this splits the parties more than anything. The way that liberals in this country have gotten portrayed by conservatives (who support big business and are against most if not all social programs, except the ones for the war machine and business), is so distorted I don't even recognize them. I've never in my 65 yrs. met a liberal like the misguided, simple-minded ones they discribe. But I have met plenty of conservative, esp. Repubs (but Dems too) who are almost living stereotypes of a simple-minded, rigid anti-people (unless you're rich or aspiring ) conservatives.\n\nI think the way you're thinking is like being in a fantasy world. It's a nice idea but people who are independents generally aren't in the fray. I don't believe their voice is heard so they have little to no effect. Females especially have been socialized to be peacemakers and I think more men should be and more women shouldn't be afraid to stand up and fight for things they care about. Women's issues, peace, helping people who are disabled, poor, elderly instead of helping the rich get richer which has been happening in a terrible degree are moral values that I think are worth fighting for.\nSwitzerland was neutral in WWII and that was, almost everyone agrees, worth fighting in. Being independent is like that. I like what Mark Twain said. He said he believed in the two-party system, that's why he was a Democrat, implying that at least two parties existed WITHIN the party. If you study the parties, there ARE big differences in them and I think the DEMOCRATIC PARTY in spite of its craziness is a better representative of the best of AMERICA.

1) Push at a comfortable speed, remember the faster you go the better the pop. \n2) Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches under your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail. \n3) Squat, so you can spring yourself up. \n4) Kick your back foot down so you can pop as you jump up, your front foot should rub upward on your griptape. \n5) Make sure you tuck your knees to your chest, picking up your back foot as well to level the board at a good height. REMEMBER you are jumping forward. \n6) Then come down comfortably, both feet on the board. It will look better if both your feet are over the bolts as well as lessen the stress of impact \n7) Finally bend your legs as you touch down to give it that smooth style and roll away stocked\n\n\n\nu have to remember to slide your foot foward,\n\nkeep practicing, i can now ollie almost two feet!
I heard New Zealand is actually one of the hardest places to migrate to. In order to even be considered you have to have a job offer. A job that is valuable to the New Zealand economy. Even with that it will take about a year to get everything in order. Another way is to have family who already live there sponsor you. Other than that you are looking at a waiting list of one year or more. Heard its beautiful and tranquil.
Well I don't know if it was a ghost or a spirit or maybe just an energy, but I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago. I was living at my parent's house at the time and they were away for the weekend so I was home alone. I had a friend come over to my house and we were just hanging out, drinking some wine and chatting. We finished the bottle of wine and I placed the empty bottle on the kitchen table next to a candle I was planning to put in it. We decided to go out to meet some people and came back about 2 hours later. When I opened the front door I saw the candle was placed in the neck of the bottle AND IT WAS LIT with only one drip of wax running down the side. I had an alarm set with motion detectors when I left the house. These candles burned very quickly, so it must have been lit just moments before I got home. I'm so glad I had a friend with me to vouch for it because no one believes it when they ehar it. Funny thing is, it was almost comforting to me because I think it was my grandmother telling me she was there to watch over me. I felt very peaceful for a while after that happened. I've been waiting for something like it to happen ever since, I have a fascination with it.

It doesn't sound like he really wants to be in a committed relationship with you. If he was serious he wouldn't have cheated. He cheated on you not once but twice, according to him. It's probably more than that like when a cop pulls over a drunk driver and they say "oh, i only had two beers". I'd say goodbye and move on. As far as going back to being platonic friends it would probably be too awkward and painful and it won't be the same as before.
Absolutely not.\n\nFor centuries, this was an accepted form of punishment for kids. Look at the myriad problems children face today: ADHD, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, drop-out rates at historic highs, pedophilia, etc.\n\nI link it all to a permissive parent paradigm. When there is no punishment, a child will do immature and antisocial things.\n\nThat's my opinion, and anyone who tries to get between my kids and me will face consequences.\n\nThis society says it's OK to kill the unborn, but don't you dare spank the born. \n\nUtter nonsense.

You read alot of propoganda
You knew the consequences of the "work release" when you were put on it. So why ask now how to avoid going to jail when you knew you would if you didn't finish your work release? You can't avoid jail. They trusted you to keep up your end of the bargain and you betrayed their trust. You made the choice not to follow through with your responsibilities, now you have to pay for it in another way.
Well, for starters, maybe cut back on the coffee a little. Caffeinated beverages are dehydrating.\n\nActually, though, I think it's probably as simple as breathing through your mouth while you're sleeping. Is it possible you have a sinus infection or a deviated septum? \n\nYou might want to give those nighttime nasal strips a shot. If you're breathing through your mouth while you sleep because your nasal passages are stuffed up, it could help.
why do you feel like you belong there? Is it because you really feel that the teachings are the truth? Or is it that Friends and family or congregation members make you feel welcome and at home? God expects us all to seek him, if you feel that this is the right place for you maybe it is for now? However, if you do not agree with the teachings, feel that they dont come from God, or you are not getting the answers you seek, you would be wise to look at why you want to stay. If you value your relationship with God, pray to him and ask him to guide you, and teach you the truth. If you are just shy, it would not take long to settle in somewhere else if you feel that you need to move on. Trust God. You might also get alot of negativity from people on here because many feel that morman is a cult, i am going to be baptised as one of Jehovahs witnesses soon, and i get ridiculed sometimes, i dont mind though, because i trust in God to take care of me, and i am loved by him, and my brothers and sisters. They are close to me as if they are related. I can count on anyone in my congregation to help me if i need it, that is how it should be. Jesus said:\n“I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:34, 35.\nHope you find your way

Murder a murderer for murder? Not only barbaric, but also illogical. Thank God Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have seen the Light and have done away with this Draconian punishment.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the probability of murdering an innocent man (look how many have been released through DNA testing).
I would rather do a fun activity than eat in a restaurant. For example, play miniature golf, go parasailing, ride a roller coaster, something like that. When you share experiences -- especially ones with an element of fear, like parasailing and roller coasters -- you make a deeper connection and are less stiff and nervous. You can get to know each other better more quickly.\n\nIf you want to eat afterward, probably somewhere a little nicer than usual. But it's probably better to cut the date short and leave her wanting more!
Ask your counselors on a regular basis how you're doing and what you can do to improve your work for them. Let them know you strive to be an exceptional employee and that you're open to suggestions.\n\nThat action there may be enough to push you up into the "exceptional" category. I've seen it work.

You can play around more in the regular season than in the playoffs. In the Playoffs, you have to play a more complete brand of basketball to win. Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring.

What time frame are you looking at? The higher the risk the more profitable the return but at the same time the more chance of losing your money. The more legal your investment the less profitable too. Investment in Caribbean countries are paying good money right now. If you are young and want to take on a decent amount of risk. I would invest in financial commodities Euros to be exact. in commodities you can control a 200:1 ratio with your $5000 you can control $1000000 US worth of Euros as the Euro will rise you keep the profits when you think it high enough say $15000000 sell and pay back the 1000000 and pay you broker and keep your nice profit of roughly $450000 US. Believe me when I say the Euro is going to rise against the dollar this year especially with the economy about to tank thanks to our election results. Iraqis about to boil over the Middle East is abut to ignite and Europe is the only stable continent.

5/16 equals 0.3125. It's less than 0.313 unless .313 is a rounded off number. It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.
NOPE U CANT
if they do that...where would you go???
I think that she may be using you....and maybe she feels guilty thats whys shes brushing you off. Sorry buddy but say you cant drive her to work anymore unless she starts paying you gas....but say you would like to see her otherwise. See what she says once the tables are turned.

well looks like your just going to have to get over urself. If she is stayin in touch with you and is coming to see you well then you need to stop worryin for nothing. Long distance relationships are hard and this is one of the reasons they dont make it cause of the trust issue. If you love her then dont worry about it. Your only thinkin of things that will ruin it. And accusing her will only end it for you. Unless she stops talkin to you or gettin mad at you for no reason things like that then really stop worrying it's just distance.
am doing nvq as well.. so wats is on abt i mean the question mite be able to help

Did you know that special ed kids are give the same tests as the regular kids? In Louisiana instead of the WASL they have the LEAP test, and I have a cousin who dropped out of special ed because he (his whole class) was give then same LEAP as the regular kids in his "grade" and he couldn't pass it three times. That's some kinda bull.

The truth is that whether you drop the charges or not, the prosecutor still makes the ultimate decision whether or not the state wants to press charges. This may be totally out of your hands...particularly if he committed some of these offenses against others. Even if you don't want to testify, if you get subpoenaed, you better show up and whatever you do, do not perjure yourself!

My husband had the same problems switching from Paxil to Wellbutrin and had to stay on Paxil and stop using Wellbutrin. Call your doctor as soon as possible and let them know what is happening.
The bad check would be my biggest worry, it is possible that a warrant for your arrest was issued, depending on local/state laws. Which could still be outstanding, I would definitely check, I'd hate to get pulled over for a minor traffic violation or check check upon reentry by customs and find out I had an outstanding warrant for my arrest, even though the charges are minor and would probably only involve paying a fine and/or monies owed, it would be a BIG hassle. I'd check on it and clear it up BEFORE my return, if I were you.\n\nExperian is one of the BIG 3 credit reporting agencies along with Trans-Union and Equifaq. You should check all 3 to get an accurate picture of your credit in the US. Also credit scores are available from all 3 (which will vary up to 40 points from place to place) and the average score is 675. Anything 675 and up you should have no problem with getting a credit card, bank account, etc. \n\nOh one more place to check is Chex Systems, they are kind of like a credit reporting agency except the keep records of people who have accounts closed at banks due to overdrafts and similar situations. Many Large and Local banks will not open an account for you if you have been reported to chex systems, although a quick internet search of "Bank account NO chex systems" will return several internet banks that will open account (usually with less favorable terms and higher fee's) even if you have been reported to chex.\n\nIn my opinion most of these problems would have disappeared after 11 years, long ago written off, execpt for the bad check.\n\nGood luck.

marketing firms think they know more than us, and so they behave accordingly. In addition, they want to educate us (they call it informing us), but it has a negative consequence when their ego gets in the way. That's my take. Please don't get insulted by my answers -- just another point of view.
I started smoking because I could not sleep/insomnia after I broke up with someone. Since then I smoke everyday and my insomnia gone totally till now. \nThe question now how can I stop my addiction? I have tried to quit but many people around me smoke, too. So, I am feeling some kind of peer presure. I know it is not healthy however, I do enjoy smoking because it gives me certain 'buzz' and calm me down when I am stressed. It also enhance my mood!

2000 YEARS OF WORLD HISTORY \nThe "Historical Folding Rule" visualizes history on two different levels. \nThe Event Side\nOn the event side, each centimeter represents ten years of world history. It recalls significant data from the Roman times until the Millenium, from Jesus Christ to the Internet. \nThe Periods Side \nThe periods side presents world history divided into its fundamental periods. Entries on intellect, powers, and the arts on a backdrop ranging from LATE ANTIQUITY until the MODERN TIMES provide a context for individual events. \nOther than conventional history books the "Historical Folding Rule" elucidates historical correlations in an extraordinary way: it provides a synthesis of clarity, keen intellect and wit.

I had an arguement with a Christian friend of mine. When I asked her, "Why doesn't God just make everyone happy" I got a bunch of canned responses (God works in mysterious ways, God wants to give us choice...as if anyone could comprehend what God wants (if there is a God)). Finally she just said, "I don't know...I'm not God". THAT'S an honest answer! I agree, I would rather hear an honest, thought-out response than lines that have been fed to you
Migrating birds tend to stop on their journey on local lakes and water reservoirs where if they have with them a bird flue virus then they may contaminate the local surroundings and local animals and birds with that virus which in turn can be transmitted to poultry farms where it may infect the poultry birds. When a human being consumes a bird flu virus infected Bird then he may get infected bird Flu.However if the Chicken is cooked above 80 degree Celsius temperature the virus is unable to sustain after that temperature so even if you eat a bird flu infected bird but yet cook above 80 degree Celsius you will not catch Bird Flu.

If you live near Mexico you can get dental work done much cheaper than in the US. If you have a good, caring doctor let him/her know how you are feeling about yourself and ask if there is a dentist that they know of that could help you at a greatly reduced rate. Surely there are some decent, caring dentists somewhere out there. If the dentists have web sites you could send each a message and let them know of your situation and see if there is anyone of them willing to help you.
This is probably one of the most difficult things to stop doing for most golfers. One that may help is to think about keeping your right elbow (assuming you're a righty) closer to your body on your downswing.

The reality of it is that liberal leadership is excatly what got us into this mess in the first place. What people don't seem to understand is that muslim fundamentalism is the anthithesis of anything liberal at all. They view liberalism as evil, and see the United States as a champion of liberalism, and is thus a champion of evil ideals. \n\n\nI do not agree. I believe everyone should be free to make their own choices. Fundamental Islam, would strip us of all of our civil liberties and have us praying to Allah, 7 times a day, covering our women up, killing gays, Jews, Christians, and Blacks, censoring our papers, strip us of freedom of speach and so on. So while these are the rights we are fighting to protect, it is not the style of government that would win this war. These people respond to an iron fist, not a bleading heart, that being the case we must pound them into the ground with our conservative iron fist, so that we and those that want it are free to make our own choices.

We normally believe it is the wives jobs to take care of the household upkeep . . . while we take care of household financial burden.\n\nI know that is old fashioned . . . but that is how men view things.

Also, with inflation and the cost of living going up (I blame women's lib and women in the workforce for that too - do research on inflation how it went up from before before women's lib to after women's lib. - I don't have the numbers in front of me anymore . . . but the inflation . . . if I remember correctly . . . multiplied by approx 8 or 9 since women decided to remain in the workforce.)\n\nNow-a-day . . . in some middle-low class families . . . you have to have two income families.

I think we are just wired that way - if humans were the kind of species to lie back and smell the roses, we probably would still life in caves and hunt with stone spears. \nIf we do well and get something, we are happy only for a while. So if we want that happy feeling again, we obviously have to go out and try to get something else again to re-capture that feeling. Also, as we are successful and acquire something, we usually get admired (and envied) by the people around us, a rather pleasant feeling. This admiration by others probably is expressed in all kind of pro-creative ways, therefore making it likely that this trait will get passed on. \nSo it would seem that we have the whole weight of evolution weighing in against us when it comes to contendedness.
depends how serious you guys are...and how mature. If ur not comfortable doig it....only bad can come of it. but if you're both ready go for it....of course use the right protection!

Sure lets substitute one form of discrimination for another good idea. Now instead of being proud of what they accomplished they will always know they didnt have to work as hard as other people because they were given positions. \nI think reverse descrimination fuels a new type of racism. I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just beacause of their race. And on top of that they get money for being their. So congradulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.

LOL. welcome to life. Iam married and broke up with my first true love over 9 years ago, and i still think of him and compare things to him. Theres something about your first love that never leaves you.\n\nYoure not betraying him. If he has moved on with his life and you havent then you should feel glad that he has made himself happy and you should do the same. Or if youre able and he's free maybe you could try expressing all these things to him. \n\nAlot of the time in retrospect it seems like we broke up with our first loves for all the wrong reasons, but in actuality we're such infants in love at that stage that who we were then is not who we are now. The compatibility changes and the person we long for and miss so horribly doesnt exist any longer.\n\nJust keep looking, there is always true love waiting.

I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam. Though routines performed on each event may be short, they are physically exhausting and push the gymnast's strength, flexibility, endurance and awareness to th

Get the fundamentals down first. Some of the simplest things people forget. Don't look down when you dribble. Deliver a 2 hand chest or bounce pass. Set picks, roll off the screen, etc etc. \n\nJust goto your local parks and get in a pickup game. If they're all heads and shoulders better than you, good. That's the only way you'll get better. You need to play with people who are better than you. Good luck.

If you're concerned about that, doesn't sound like things are quite over yet with your best guy friend. As far as he's concerned. You can keep things on the downlow, in reality, this new guy just asked you on a date...not like you're headed into another relationship.\n\nOr you can be upfront, but prepared for a little drama (since it sounds like you ended things pretty recently).\n\nIf things are over, things are over, but I do understand that you need to approach things with a little sensitivity. I'd be upfront (assuming there is closure to the relationship, if not, close it). If he's still reeling from your break up, you may need to duck out of his life for a little while (sucks, but it may be for the better).
Writing a Case Study \n\nThere are two types of case studies: factual ones depicting real organizations, people, and situations and fictional ones that, although usually based loosely on actual people and events, do not use real organization's or people's names. The advantages of factual case studies are that they can provide a wealth of detail, give credibility to situations and problems, and, most important, provide real outcomes. Actual results give those who analyze a case real-world solutions: How did the organization or manager solve the problems? Did the solutions work? \n\nFactual cases furnish concrete, not theoretical, solutions. When discussing factual cases, analysts tend to focus on the accuracy of the details rather than on the appropriateness of the solutions. Factual cases tend to become outdated as organizations, strategies, problems, and people change over time. Also, if a factual case portrays real organizations or people in a negative way, questions of taste, fairness, and even libel can arise. When writing a factual case stay with the facts, limit discussion to only those management topics that are constructive in the case.\n\nThe most effective use of factual cases are for describing current organizational problems, then analyzing and attempting to solve the problems using a consultative approach. Fictional cases have the drawback that students can never know if a solution worked or not. \n\nThere are several ways to present a case history. A case history may include: \n\nstate the problem, \nhistory/background of the facts, \nanalysis of the problem, and \nrecommendation \nconclusion - if needed\nSometimes one or more of these categories may be sub-divided. Consider the "analysis" section. A problem may be analyzed in terms of the "internal" or "external" environment. For example the local government may have a specific problem with safety issues. This issue could be the result of poor training, insufficient number of employees, or poor morale. Such problems would be considered internal problems. Therefore, an "external" problem may be an issue that is located outside of the locale.\n\nCase studies do not have to be restricted to problems and how-not-to situations; they can show solutions and how-to situations also. A case study can address several problems and show what was done right in solving them. Often the best teaching cases are those that contain both appropriate and inappropriate problem solutions. By using this technique, writers do not signal to readers that all the solutions are either right or wrong--case analysts have to figure it out for themselves. \n\nState the Problem - in two or three sentences. \n\nHistory/Background of Facts - Summarize the facts in the case.\n\nAnalysis of the Problem - Analysis often is the most difficult section of a case history to write. Sometimes there is a fine line between summary and analysis and/or analysis and recommendation. In your analysis you may discuss the causes of the problem as well as the impact of the problem. This section of your case history is important because you are evaluating the problem(s) so that you can make a recommendation or present a plan to correct the problems. Avoid words such as "must," "should," "need to." Do not make recommendations in this section.\n\nRefer to your summary and ask yourself some basic questions, for example. \n\nWhat were the conditions which allowed the problem to develop? In our case, the problem is…"what is the overall status of the management of environmental matters in urban governments?" \nWhy did the soil get in its present state - contaminated? \nWho was responsible for the dumping? \nWho was affected by the contaminated soil? \nWhat are the short and long range effects of the contaminated soil? \n \n\nRecommendations - In this section you provide direction. Based on the information you have gathered and your ana
The reason is to keep one branch from being too powerful. One branch making all of the branches decisions is a dictatorship. Dictatorship is when one party controls the making, execution, and interpretation of the law. The "Federalism" idea, keeps one branch from being too powerful, and keeping one legislation from being too powerful. That is why the House of Representatives, Senate, and Congress all work for different aspects of the government, and why they are seperated is simply to keep one legislation from ruling all aspects of the Government.

Previously chemoprophylaxis with INH, isolation of patient were done. Nowdays we don't isolate the patient and it is not necessary to take chemoprophylaxis also if your one member has got TB.\n\nThe best way is to treat the patient with short term chemoprypholaxis. If we give even single dose of Rifampicin the communicability of TB will reduce drastically upto 60%. \n\nSo have a standard treatment is enough.\n\nAnother thing we can't avoid acquisition of TB, most of us are infectd with TB, and shows diseases in certain conditions like low immunity, AIDS and other condition when body fight system is poor.\n\nKeep you member in your home, give him/her atandard antiTB drugs, say him to use towel during coughing or sneezing, proper disposal of sputum and give him fresh air, good nutrition.\n\nHowever if the member is your intimate like partner and you can't avoid and he/she is in active stage then only you can take INH chemoprophylaxis, however is is is taken, it should be taken for long duration.
Most of your classes will be on west campus once you start actually getting into your major classes. Have you gotten you basics (eng, hist, gov) out of the way. If so, then youll probably be taking mostly sciences (chem, bio) and it doesnt really matter where you live. Only your biochem and biomed classes will be on west campus (closer to north side). If your on South side, the commons are best. None of the dorms are stellar but the commons is one of the best. Living on campus the first year is fun...youll make friends in ANY dorm you choose! Congrats on getting in! Gig Em!
Strange question.\n\nThey all do.\n\nJust remember that their job is to get a politician elected. This can mean that they will often suggest the most popular answer to an issue rather than the most effective.

I guess because its become so marketable. I have seen it on sports show just a couple of weekends ago. I remember at the end of some paint-balling days, (to get a couple of more games in) we would shorten the field and just go straight at each other and it was good fun. The guns were old pumps and a couple of the new semis.
no,wait do u really like her if u do u shouldnt care about that.
No, you do not need to be certified. From my experience in starting my consulting firm, everyone claims to be an expert, but they don't know what they are talking about. In about 6 months, you will know more than all of the books put together. So don't sweat it. It just is not that important.\n\nNo, you do not need a business plan. Whoever told you that you needed one is wrong. Business plans are primarily used to get financing from a bank, which you are not going to get for a service business. Since this is only going to be a micro busniess venture, you will spend more time updating your spreadsheets than using the plan. Since you plan on transitioning from a full-time job to this, you are set financially. Don't let this bogus requirement get you down.\n\nYou do need a marketing plan. For your business, I would strongly recommend Guerilla Marketing by Jay Conrad Levinson. Pick a few marketing techniques that you are comfortable with and go at it. Just off the top of my head, I would have business cards, web site, stationery, flyers, and attend networking events. Your potential clients should include salesman (notoriously disorganized), real estate agents, insurance agents, independent consultants, and executives who want an assistant but their company won't let them hire one directly. You want to be marketing regularly. Again, GM by Levinson is perfect for you.\n\nIf I was looking for a virtual assistant, I would only be interested in references and a client list. Having stated that, your first priority should be to define what exactly you are willing to do? Payroll, travel arrangements, online research, telemarketing, etc. Once you have an idea of what you will do, I would make up a cost sheet and a list of references. Since you do not have any clients, use personal references. The only other question I have that your clients would share is how well are you going to help me when you have a full-time job.\n\nAlthough I do not use VA's, I know small business owners that swear by them. I also know that there were times when I was stuck in an airport that I would have loved having someone to call who could get me the hell out of there or arrange a hotel or something. \n\nBest of luck to you.

Would my creator be my father, my mother, or both of them?\n\nI don't believe that mankind has invented all deities. I am polytheistic and believe that pretty much any deity could exist, but that none of them have claim to the One True Way (some of them might want to convince their followers of that to get some exclusive worship, though). No one can prove that any deities were or were not invented, however, no matter how much they may believe one way or the other. I personally see evidence of higher powers, but multiple deities makes more sense to me than one due to the diversity found in all other aspects of the universe and the fact that (if deities exist at all) there is no logical evidence to show why one is real and another is not. Plus, believing in One True God makes so many people so damn arrogant, and I'm not interested in that.

Who says they aren't held accountable? The following is taken from Associated Press:\n\n"Since the 1970s, more than a dozen congressmen have been convicted in criminal court. Their cases and sentences include: \n\n— Rep. Andrew J. Hinshaw, R-Calif., spent a year in jail after being convicted in 1976 of accepting bribes when he was county tax assessor. He lost the primary election and resigned at the end of his term. \n\n— Rep. Charles Diggs Jr., D-Mich., was convicted in 1978 of operating a payroll kickback scheme in his congressional office. He served seven months of a three-year prison term. He was re-elected, then resigned in 1980. \n\n— Rep. Michael Myers, D-Pa., served 20 ½ months of a three-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from FBI agents impersonating Arab businessmen. He was convicted in 1980 and expelled from Congress. \n\n— Four other House members were convicted in the Arab businessmen bribery scandal: Democratic Reps. John Murphy of New York, Frank Thompson and John Jenrette of New Jersey, and Raymond Lederer of South Carolina. Thompson and Murphy were sentenced to three years; Jenrette, two years; and Lederer, one year. \n\n— Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., was convicted in 1988 of extorting nearly $2 million from defense contractor Wedtech Corp. He resigned from Congress and served two years and two months of an eight-year sentence. He was defeated for re-election in 1992.\n\n— Rep. Mel Reynolds, D-Ill., was sentenced in 1995 to five years in prison for having sex with an underage campaign worker. He resigned from Congress, then was sentenced in 1997 to 6 ½ years for bank fraud and other violations. The second sentence, which was to run at the same time as first, was commuted in 2001 by President Clinton. \n\n— Rep. Walter Tucker III, D-Calif., was sentenced in 1996 to two years and three months in prison for accepting and demanding bribes while mayor of a Los Angeles suburb. He resigned from Congress a week after his 1995 conviction. \n\n— Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., pleaded guilty in 1996 to two felony mail fraud charges, lost re-election and served 15 months in prison. Clinton pardoned him in 2000."
I think you and your cousin need to go to therapy because there is something just a little wrong about sleeping together in any manner of the word.

1st talk to family and friends about your problem and see if they know of any place you could get treated for your depression.\n\nIf you go to your doctor or any doctor for a 1-time fee, they can diagnose you with depression and then you can be eligible for Medicaid services, as I am, and they will pick up the bill for medications and psychiatric therapy as well.\n\nIf you can't do this for whatever reason, then you should go the natural way, i.e. buy St. John's Wort, Green Tea, and other natural aides for depression.\n\nCheck out these links for all-natural remedies for depression that are worth their cost.
I think there's some truth to that quote, but those who assume atheists have no morality simply because they don't believe in supernatural beings haven't educated themselves.\n\nI believe in fair play. Probably the best phrasing of this moral precept is the Golden Rule. Treat others with respect. Each person has the right to pursue happiness and fulfillment in his own way, so long as it does not harm others or prevent them from pursuing the same in their own way.

i do. i had a weird symptom, tho. i was having deep, sharp abdominal pains that I couldn't get diagnosed as anything until a surgeon recommended I get an MRI and I found out it was a herniated disc. I went to a chiropractor for about 3 monoths (which never really helped all that much) but once I started working out again, the pain subsided as I got stronger. \n\nMy advice? See a physical therapist because they will be able to strengthen your abs and back to a point where you will overcome the injury. And supposedly, all nerve damage should heal (if it's going to) within 6 months, so after that, you will know if the pain is going to stay with you or not.

You can not mix ECC with nonECC. However you can get another 512mb ECC RDRAM to go with the 512mb ECC RDRAM you already have. But you should make sure the system even supports ECC before you buy the other pair. Also check and see if the system can support up to 1024mb of ram because you might have to go lower.

Another option is if you have a friend that has a video you want, simply click on that video, it should have a link, and get the code from there. Once you have the code, highlight it, right click, copy, then bring up your profile and paste under the "about me" section or whatever section you want it under. Hope this helps!

I don't think most laws are tied to the Church. However, our legal system is based on our Judaic/Christian heritage. \n\nThe notion of separation of Church and State is not in the Bible nor is it in our Constitution, Bill of Rights, or any of the founding documents. The phrase comes from Thomas Jefferson but has been taken out of context and twisted around so bad it is not funny. Go to the 1st link below and you will see what I mean.\n\nThen read The Amendments to the Constitution at the 2nd link. Note the first section of the 3rd amendment:\n"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;"\n\nThis means that congress is not allowed to make laws establishing a national religion nor interfering with the freedom of worship. That was one of the great abuses in England.\n\nSome of the states did have official religions for a while and this was not prohibited by the national government. The prohibition was only on the Federal government.\n\n\nThe Constitution that REQUIRES a separation of church and state is from the old Soviet Union.\n\n\nAs to whether we would still have some of the same laws if we had not had the Ten Commandments--I think so because God created us in His spiritual image. He has placed within each of us a sense of what is right and what is wrong. Granted many people work hard at ignoring that sense BUT I still believe it is there.
Woohoo! Another Arizonian here!

Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding or a significant unexplained change in your menstrual cycle, bleeding when something comes in contact with the cervix, such as during sexual intercourse or insertion of a diaphragm, pain during sexual intercourse, and abnormal vaginal discharge containing mucus that may be tinged with blood. As it progresses, symptoms can include anemia because of abnormal vaginal bleeding, ongoing pelvic, leg, or back pain, urinary problems because of blockage of a kidney or ureter, leakage of urine or fecal content into the vagina because an abnormal opening has developed between the vagina and the bladder or rectum, and weight loss.

Yeah, they call them lawyers or attorneys. You can find a bunch in your neighborhood by looking in the phone book and most will meet with you once for free.\n\nAs to rental rights, many cities have a local tenant rights council that can answer your questions, often for free and some even provide legal representation for low income tenants with real problems.\n\nGood luck.

yes cuz when u dont call a girl she starts to think ur not thinking of her, and if ur not thinking of her u must be thinking of someone else, girls like to know there on there boyfriends mind, next time call her at least once a day even if its just to say hi, dont orget to tell her u miss her, even if you saw her an hour ago.
WTF hahahahaha
for both your sakes you need to upfront with her and just tell her that things have changed and your dont have the same feelings for her as you first thought. that she seems to be less interested in you and its best to take a break until you both know what you want in your relationship.

Both. It depends on the context. Someone can say, "things are good but only going to go downhill from here" meaning things are going to get worse. Or they can say "that was easy, and it's only goes downhill from here" meaning things will be easier.
Length has nothing to do with the belts speed of course. Length only makes sure they reach all pulleys involved. The speed of any belt is based on diameter of the pulleys they turn and the driving forces (drive pulley) to the belt.\nOf course the more or wider belts you have the better the grip to the pulleys if high torgue loads on the pulleys are expected.
You can try pay per click programs such as Google Adwords http://www.google.com/adwords or Yahoo Search Marketing http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com – though the key is to carefully track your ROI and which keywords actually perform well\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\nRecommend Site Scripts (various) http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nBig Nose Bird Recommend this Site http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml \nCGI Resource Index http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nHostscripts http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. \n\nhttp://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html\nhttp://i-newswire.com/\nhttp://www.24-7pressrelease.com/\nhttp://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi\nhttp://www.pr.com/press-releases\nhttp://www.prfree.com/\nhttp://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml\nhttp://www.theopenpress.com/\nhttp://www.przoom.com/\nhttp://www.prweb.com\nhttp://www.newswiretoday.com/\nhttp://www.free-press-release.com/\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of where to submit your articles http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AhzreGmnCUicOoyedqypscUjzKIX?qid=1006022407481\n\n6. Post a link to your site for free where it is allowed (always read the Terms of Use). Examples are:\n\nCraigslist http://www.craigslist.com\nGoogle Base http://base.google.com\nClassifieds for Free http://www.classifiedsforfree.com/...\nText Link Exchange http://www.txtswap.com/\nRecycler.com http://www.recycler.com/\nYahoo Classifieds http://classifieds.yahoo.com/\nUS Free Ads http://www.usfreeads.com/

It's persecution and stripping the rights from the students.It shouldn't be left up to no one else but the students.Just another form of how the secular world is continuing to persecute the christians of this nation.\n\nWho said it was a forced class.If the students want to take the class as an elective for more points or whatever,so be it.Every person in this country should have the right to learn about the bible if they so please.\n\nFrom what I can tell,you're being a biggot,and no better than a common terrorist.Why don't you go to work for the ACLU,that way you can get payed with your very own tax dollars.\n\nThe ACLU is nothing more than a terrorist group.\n\nBesides,the ACLU is nothing but a bunch of crooks.They will eventually bite the hand that feeds them,and they will stab their supporters in the back.

Yes...I have seen those posts, and plenty of them and again Yes i do think it is very funny. I think the posts are mostly from supporters of illegals already established in America. There is a difference between supporting immigrants and supporting illegal immigrants. The vast majority of people who claim they are supporting immigrants are really supporting ONLY illegals. If they were actually supporting immigrants they would be just as offended as Americans and Legal immigrants by the way these illegals show no respect for those who actually entered this country by the legal process.

Dear Dejav,\nYour pertinent question and urgent curiosity has unfortunately, been buried under more legitimate concerns. If you don't get an answer within 24 hours, it is best to delete your query and ask again.\nDejav, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion. You have been foolish, Dejav. Very, very foolish. Anyone can see that the purpose of Yahoo! Answers is to serve as a modern chatroom. More and more, Java programming is becoming less and less supported, there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create PHP scripts where the "thinking" can be done on the server rather than on your machine. With that in mind, Dejav, you should interrogate the shallow-minded participants of Yahoo! Answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator. Questions such as, "How long is the normal tally whacker?" or, "My boyfriend says I should dump my hubby, what you think?"..., would get you a substantial number of replies.\nGive up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders, Dejav. Quit asking bland, colorless questions. Are you naive? No person who is capable of giving you the answer you hoped for can last while reading though a heap of puddings, pies and pastry. I'm only doing you a favor, Dejav, by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology. When you are ready, send your atonement to http://surveys.yahoo.com/user_ad_feedback \nAnd Dejav, if you insist upon asking serious questions, remember that a few good jolts from a peace officer's tazor should bring you around to your senses. Please, check your spelling and throw some slang into the mix so you don't offend any of the egos lurking, waiting to pounce on you with crass, thoughtless one-liners.\n\nThank you Dejav, and have a great day!\n-dylan

To expand on the previous answer: the first major league game was April 22, 1876 between the Boston Red Caps and the Philadelphia Athletics. No home run was hit in that game.\n\nThe first home run was hit by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings on May 2, 1876 against the Cincinnati Red Stockings. (Charley Jones of the Red Stockings hit a homer later in the game for the 2nd home run in history.)

I'm not familiar with that specific game, but most games have minimum requirements for the PC they are to be played on. You can usually get away with being close to those specs if you don't meet them outright, by lowering the levels of eye candy (resolution, anti-aliasing, available features and detail levels, etc.) but the game may simply require more than your video card can provide. In unusual cases a really fast computer can provide some of the capabilities of the graphics card in the CPU, but you'd probably have a fast graphics card to match a fast CPU anyway.\n\nThe 16MB of the video card speaks to how large a texture map it can hold -- the texture map is an image that gets draped over a surface in the game by the video card to make it appear more detailed and complex then it really is. Since your error message says "MISSING TEXTURE" I'd have to believe it didn't have enough room in the available RAM on the video card to hold the surfaces it needed to apply in the game. Good luck.

It is nice to know that someone your age is thinking about the future. It is wise to put 10% on your earnings into some sort of savings.

WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT DEATH\n\nJesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.—1 Corinthians 15:6.\n\nLEARNING FROM THE RESURRECTION ACCOUNTS\n\nThe Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he had been “conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.—John 11:11.\nThe account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. \n\nThink about this too: If Lazarus had been in heaven for those four days, would he not have said something about it?— And if he had been in heaven, would Jesus have made him come back to earth from that wonderful place?— Of course not!\n\nYet, many people say that we have a soul, and they say that the soul lives on after the body dies. They say that Lazarus’ soul was alive somewhere. But the Bible does not say that. It says that God made the first man Adam “a living soul.” Adam was a soul. The Bible also says that when Adam sinned, he died. He became a “dead soul,” and he returned to the dust from which he had been made. The Bible also says that all Adam’s offspring inherited sin and death too.\n\nThe Scriptural teaching of the resurrection, however, is not compatible with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If an immortal soul survived death, no one would need to be resurrected, or brought back to life. Indeed, Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul that was living on elsewhere after death. She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some spirit realm to continue his existence. On the contrary, she showed her faith in God’s purpose to reverse the effects of death. She said: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (John 11:23, 24) Likewise, Lazarus himself related no experiences of some afterlife. There was nothing to report.\n\nClearly, according to the Bible, the soul dies and the remedy for death is the resurrection.

Dude!\n\nAre you really falling for her story?\n\nLOL\n\n.
they banned it because in the constitution it says that america would not have an official religion. therefore, anyone can have the freedom to practice their religion here or believe in whatever they want. we may not pray in school but we do have a 30 second moment of silence. so you can pray then if you wanted. If you really want prayer in school go to a parochial school. i used to go to one. In a public school you can join a religious club and pray there also.
I'm not a personal trainer, but have you tried changing your routine. exercise more one day and less one day the same with diet. you need to shake up your plan doing the same thing all the time can put you on a plateau.\n\nPS I just don't know why some have to be so rude,but then it's their lack of maturity and vanity.. Good Luck!!!!
The heart of humanism is believing in yourself as opposed to a god. I would start out by asking the kids how many times a day they're told to believe in themselves. Then I'd tell them that today we're going to study where that statement comes from.
Because people like to talk about themselves & listen to stuff that matters to them.

Go back to your trig function definitions. Suppose you have a right triangle with sides of length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c. Let x be the angle between side b and hypotenuse c. Then, using the symbol ^ to denote an exponent,\n\nsin (x) = a/c\ncos (x) = b/c\nsec (x) = 1/cos (x) = c/b\n\nThe squares are:\n\nsin^2 (x) = a^2 / c^2\ncos^2 (x) = b^2 / c^2\nsec^2 (x) = c^2 / b^2\n\nPlugging these definitions into your problem,\n\n(a^2 / c^2) / (b^2 / c^2) = (c^2 / b^2) - 1\n\nSimplifying,\n\na^2 / b^2 = c^2 / b^2 - 1\n\nMultiplying by b^2,\n\na^2 = c^2 - b^2\n\nRearranging terms,\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhich may be recognized as the Pythagorean Theorem.
as pressure is directly proportional to density. so for fixed volume pressure is directly proportional to mass so\np1/p2 = m1/m2\np1=3400 p2=3600 m1= 1000 ltrs m2=x\nso we find m2=1058.82 ltrs\nso we need 58.82 ltrs convert into kgs\nby finding density of nitrogen gas.\nhope this helps

How safe they are depends on how powerful they are. They radiate in the infrared so the light isn't visible. \n\nYou'll need a tube with electrodes spaced apart a few feet with wires coming in. You'll need a high voltage source, maybe a transformer from a neon light hooked to the wires. \n\nYou'll need a vacuum pump and you'll need to pump the tube down to about 5 mm of pressure while you feed in a mixture of helium, neon and carbon dioxide. You'll have to look up the mixing ratio.\n\nYou'll need something to seal the end of the tube with. Ideally you'll have mirrors but more than likely the mirrors will be external. One will have to be reflective the other should half silvered and of a type that won't absorb the infrared light. Most glass will absorb the light and you won't get any output. Some plastics work and you can always put the mirrors outside the tube (one with a pin-hole in it) and use Brewster angles (look it up) to seal the end of the tube... No glass on the seals; special plastics or sodium chloride plates work. \n\nThen you'll need an infrared detector; the light is invisible and a lot of patience aligning the mirrors.
Sandra it is easy and fun. your best bet is to use that half hour to strengh train.Start off light and get your technique down.Go to a gym or get a strengh training book.\nIn few short weeks you will be a expert and see results.

I was in the so called true religion and I found out it was a major sham. Some people are so scared of being alone they can't face the fact that their religion and organization is NOT perfect. They shut their eyes and turn their heads and make up excuses cause they don't have the guts to see what is right in front of them! They need someone else to control everything they do and make all their choices for them. (Churchofjohnnycash couldn't have said it better) I got out, even though I was scared and I payed a big price, I lost my family and everyone I knew, but I couldn't be happier, I couldn't live a lie, could you? Who would want a family or friends that were nothing but a sham.

Rwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\nDespite efforts by Rwanda’s new government, the United Nations (UN), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Rwanda’s recovery from genocide has been slow and far from steady. At a December 1997 press conference, United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed that the United States and Rwanda “must account for the past in order to forge a more just future.” In the following article, written for Encarta Yearbook, author Gérard Prunier explains why this may be difficult to accomplish.\n\n\nRwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\n\nBy Gérard Prunier\n\n\nOne of the 20th century's worst atrocities—the brutal slaughter of approximately 800,000 people in the East African nation of Rwanda in 1994—still demands an accounting.\n\n\nThree years after the genocide ended, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), created by the United Nations (UN), has yet to bring a war criminal to justice. In contrast, the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), established in 1993 to try war crimes committed during the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has proceeded relatively smoothly. The ICTY reached its first conviction in May 1997. The ICTR's lack of progress has led many Rwandans to believe that the outside world is more concerned about “ethnic cleansing” in Europe than about mass atrocities in east central Africa.\n\n\nOn April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down by unknown assailants as his plane approached the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Habyarimana's death triggered a chain of events in which neighbor turned on neighbor and friend upon friend. Murders occurred within families as ethnic Hutu killed their ethnic Tutsi relatives. Many Hutu priests refused asylum to Tutsi fugitives, and some Hutu schoolteachers actually murdered their Tutsi students. Although the violence appeared spontaneous, it was in fact planned. Many reports in Western news media inaccurately described what was happening as a tribal conflict. The true causes lay elsewhere.\n\nRoots of the Conflict\n\n\nThe conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi in east central Africa was not new. Nor was it the product of ancient tribal hatreds as was so often reported. The Hutu and Tutsi are not tribes. A tribe is a distinct community with its own language, customs, territory, and religion. Hutu and Tutsi in the nations of Rwanda and Burundi share the same territory, speak the same languages (Kinyarwanda in Rwanda, Kirundi in Burundi), share the same customs, practice the same religion, and frequently intermarry. The real difference between the majority Hutu (who make up between 80 and 85 percent of the population in Rwanda and Burundi) and the minority Tutsi (between 12 and 15 percent in both countries) is sociopolitical.\n\n\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of the area now known as Rwanda were the Twa. Rwanda's Hutu migrated to the region later and were well established by the time the Tutsi arrived in the 1400s. This early precolonial society was hierarchical, with Tutsi serving as the ruling aristocracy. Their status was linked to the ownership of cattle, a symbol of social distinction in many East African societies.\n\n\nHutus were not allowed to own cattle unless the cattle were given to them by a Tutsi overlord. The granting of cattle, a ceremonial process called ubuhake in Kinyarwanda, was an essential link between Tutsi social patrons and their Hutu clients. For example, Hutu soldiers who served their Tutsi masters well in war were often rewarded with cattle.\n\n\nWars in the region were frequent, but they did not pit Tutsi against Hutu. Rather, they were civil conflicts between high lineage Tutsis who were supported by their Hutu retainers in a system similar to that of medieval Europe. Or they were wars between the kingdom of Rwanda and the neighboring kingdoms of Iweju, Mpororo, Nkore, or Buha, which toda

Even if it sucks to have your period every month, it's bad to mess with mother nature. Even if the drug gets pass, is it really "safe"? It could be safe for some women but harmful for others, everyone's body is different especially concerning the menstural cycle. Perhaps not having periods could lead to other health concerns, one may never know. Is it worth that risk to save money of feminine products and get rid of some emotional stress for a couple of days to a week? Sure there's probably many positive things that others can think of that would come out of not ever having periods, but that would just make us one more step closer to males.
It may be because it's primary purpose is to question and probe the nature of reality. This includes questions as to how things have come to be, and that can step on the toes of other people's beliefs in religious creation. Anything that challenges any bit of anyone's religion will be considered evil by some.

In the first question, St. Thomas addresses sacred scripture and whether it is science, wisdom, what is its subject, whether it is a matter of argument, etc. You can read it yourself to figure out his answers:\n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/100100.htm\n\nIn Q. 12, St. Thomas addresses how God, an infinite being, may be known by us, finite creatures. This is a difficult matter, and must be addressed article by article. \n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/101200.htm\n\nFinally, in the 13th question, St. Thomas deals with the names of God, that it, whether anything can properly be said of God. \n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/101300.htm\n\nRegarding salvation, St. Thomas argues that man cannot attain happiness (a vision of God ala Q. 12) by his own action. However, "rectitude of will" is necessary on the part of man for happiness. http://www.newadvent.org/summa/200507.htm\n\nI'm not sure, however, of the 3 ways St. Thomas said that man can obtain salvation.
You can split up the (x^2-4)^(4/3) into ((x^2-4)^(1/3))*(x^2-4), because you are adding the exponents when you multiply(1/3+1=4/3). Then you can factor out the (x^2-4)^(1/3) and come up with:\n((x^2-4)^(1/3))*(8x^2+(x^2-4))\nWhich simplifies to:\n((x^2-4)^(1/3))*(9x^2-4)=0\n\nThat means two things:\n9x^2-4=0\nand\n(x^2-4)^(1/3)=0\n\nTake the first one, and you get the answer +-2/3\nTake the second one, cube both sides, and get x^2-4=0, which yields +-2.\n\nPlug all four of those answers into x to check for extraneous roots. All four work, so there are no extraneous answers.\n\nHope that helps! Tell me if something doesn't make sense.\n\nEDIT:\nTo the poster below me, ^ means "raised to the power of", and you have to hold your mouse over the equation in his post to get the whole thing.

First, put each pair of equations into "slope-intercept" form, which means that each equation is expressed as y = mx + b, where m and b are constants.\n\nPerforming this step for the three pairs of equations produces the following results:\n\n3x+y=5 and x=2y-3 \nbecomes y = -3x + 5 and y = (1/2)x + 3/2\n\ny=-x+4 and y=-x+2 is already in slope-intercept form\n\ny=-x+4 and 2x+2y=8\nbecomes y = -x + 4 and y = -x + 4\n\nNow you're ready to analyze them:\n1. if the two equations are identical, then they are "dependent." That is, for any value of x the two equations will produce the same value for y. The FULL name of this situation is "consistent, dependent." In other words, the two equations have at least one solution (i.e., they are "consistent"). And in fact they have an infinite number of solutions because they are identical (i.e., they are "dependent").\n\n2. If the two equations have the same value for m (the slope), but different values for b (the y-intercept), then they are inconsistent. That is, there are no combinations of x and y values that satisfy both equations. In graphical terms, they consist of two straight lines that do not intersect (if they intersected, that point of intersection would be a solution of the two equations). This is true because the two lines are parallel. We know that they are parallel because they have the same slope. We know that they do not meet because they have different y-intercepts (i.e., they are parallel lines that pass through the y axis at two different points).\n\nFinally, if the two equations have different slopes (different values of m), then they are consistent, independent equations. That is, they are consistent, in that there is at least one solution. And they are independent because they are not simply identical equations. How do we know this? Because the slopes are different, the two lines can not be parallel, so they must intersect. And being straight lines, they will intersect in exactly one point.\n\nThat covers all the possibilities:\n1. the lines have different slopes (different values of m), so they are not parallel (consistent, independent)\n2. the lines have the same slope (same value of m) and the same y-intercept (same value of b), so they are the same equation, and their lines exactly overlap (consistent dependent)\n3. the lines have the same slope (same value of m), but different y-intercept (different values of b), so they are parallel and non-intersecting (inconsistent)

Pipe thread compound, or "pipe dope" is available in any hardware store. Just make sure you get one that says it is rated for gas or steam usage, but I believe they all are. If you think using teflon tape might be easier to apply for your specific job, you could use that too, but if you do make sure you get the yellow tape that is coded for gas use.

You are not stuck up and vain. If that is truly your attitude about it, then you are pretty confident in yourself and it doesn't matter what anyone else says to you. That is good that you are not afraid of them and you don't have time for their words. How many teen girls really do what they say they're going to do? Please, for some reason when they run their mouth to and about you it makes them feel good about themselves. Even if you did do something mean to one of them, so what, look how they're acting. Young girls are just trying to find their own identity and where they belong so that is why they feed off of the negativity, it makes them feel good about themselves. It is so immature and unattractive. Don't feed into it and don't allow them to make you afraid. I know you probably aren't but I'm just saying be confident. P.S. Remember how fustrating this is for you, in the future make sure you don't get caught up in the drama when their attention shifts to someone else.

From my hubby's database:\n\n\nOf all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity — not to mention the force of ejaculation — vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way. \nJust like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.\nIf you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance — but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).\n\n\nConsistency of semen isn't very consistent; you've probably noticed that the thickness of your ejaculate can vary from day to day. This is because the quality of the fluid is very susceptible to a number of factors. Diet, exercise and frequency of sex can all dictate how thick or watery your emissions are, as can the tightness of the clothes that you wear (tight clothing will increase body temperature and can thus impact sperm motility. \n\nFor men of normal fertility, sperm creation is a constant, ongoing process. Millions of sperm cells are created each day in the testes; they mature in one to 3 months, after which they're ready to be ejaculated. So, since there are always sperm cells being made, there is a lot of overlap between your "loads." Once one has been released, another should not be far behind.\nActual semen quantity differs among individuals and can also change for the same individual during different times of his life. Genetics plays an important part in how much a male will ejaculate. Most males ejaculate about one teaspoon of semen. Some medications may affect the amount of semen produced. And you will notice that the longer you take between orgasms the larger the quantity of semen you will ejaculate. (You've probably noticed that if you masturbate more than once a day that the second, third or fourth time you achieve orgasm you release smaller and smaller quanitities of semen. Wait overnight and see how much more your body made while you were asleep.) Additionally, the more aroused you get and the longer you take to ejaculate, the more semen your body will produce. Foreplay — touching yourself in special ways in special places — will sometimes stimulate the body to produce more semen, since the body's reproductive glands (such as the prostate) work harder when you're aroused.\nSemen appearance and texture can change naturally over the course of months, days, or even from one ejaculation to another, due to a variety of factors inculding diet.\nSemen from a mature male is usually a milky or pearly-white color. It is not uncommon to see a yellowish tint to the semen if you've abstained from ejaculation for a while. Semen colored with red streaks may signify blood. If you occasionally see a bit of blood it's not necessarily a cause for alarm, but if you see a lot of it, or if it persists, the condition should be brought to the attention of your physician. The same goes any other drastic color changes, which may indicate infection. \nA lot of factors go into the appearance and consistency of semen, including diet, ejaculation frequency, etc., so changing any of these can alter the way your semen looks. Also, it's easy to think that semen is simply sperm cells in water, but it's a much more complex substance than that. So it may have been the absence or presence of something other than actual sperm cells — such as sugars or proteins — that caused your semen to look different before.\nA nocturnal ejaculation may have more prostatic fluid in it (which is whiter and thicker), while a da

There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect. The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave. A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass. And mass requires weight. This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected. But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc. This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

Good question, I too would like an answer to this. As far as I'm concerned gay marriages have nothing to do with my marriage, of course, neither do other straight marriages. I'm more concerned with home wrecking tramps who think a married man is a challenge.
Through my experiance the best way to "control" students is to treat them with respect, fairness, have high standards, have fun in the classroom, and have a great discipline plan. Many people like to "control" their students but I dont think that is what you want to do. You want your students to want to be in the classroom. William Glasser has some really great ideas. He feels that the classroom is also the students classroom so make them part of it. Have them help you establish the classroom rules. Dont just tell them what the rules are. Teach them things that they want to learn about. Ask them what interest them. I dont know what subject you teach but have it realate to what they like. Have a great discipline plan. If they mess up they get a strike or they have to sign their name in a behavior log folder. If they get more than 3 strikes than they dont get to participate in "fun friday" that occurs at the end of every nine weeks. Instead of eating pizza and chips with everyone they go to the library or another teachers classroom. \nStudents will push their limits. But you can not try to control them. Nobody likes to be controlled. Control only causes more resistance. What you need to do is make the class about them.
OMG this is so true! \nThe girl is totally clueless. I think she walks around with her head up her ar5e. If you disagree with her she says, "crybaby pc liberals" or "liberal pusses" (yeah spelt that way). But you ask her a valid question and she won't answer it. I don't know how she can say she likes politics when she's so ignorant. I said it before and I'll say it again. Before you start to bad mouth others you should look in your own back garden. She's against immigration but without it she wouldn't be here. Hello Americans are immigrants (except the Native Americans). \nDoes that make sense? \nShe doesn't like asylum seekers but she supports Jews in America. Hello they were seeking asylum from Nazi Germany! This woman is seriously mixed up. \n\nBut get this- in one of her answers she states she wouldn't b1tch slap a pc do-gooder because of the liberal in her.\n\nHey Jane L why do you call everyone who disagrees with you a PC liberal? Are those the only words you know?\n\nEverything is black and white to her. She can't see that people can have views that are liberal and views that are conservative. What an idiot. The whole idea of a debate is that you talk, listen and answer but she just talks. She won't answer or listen.\n\nYou know what I learned? She's not worth the effort just ignore this poor creature. You can't debate with a child.

Hardwired systems are made to perform in a set manner, implemented with logic, switches, etc. between any input and output in the system. Once the manner in which the control is executed, you can not change the behavior of the system.\n\nMicroprogrammed systems are centered around a computer of some sort, often a microcontroller in small systems, that controls the system using a program. Input is sent to the computer, and the program determines what should be done with the input to come up with an output. So the processor is between the input and the output, rather than a direct link between the input and output.\n\nThe vesatility of the microprogrammed system far exceeds the hardwired system. The systems can also be considerably smaller. The size of a complex microcontroller can be quite a bit smaller that a bunch of logic and switches for the same functionality.\n\nThis what you were looking for?

Take a look at this:\n\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\n \nFound this list at Human Events Online\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\n\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.

I am sooooo sorry!! I went through the exact same thing!!!! Only it went on for quite some time before I realized he wouldn't ever marry me! I was so completely DEVASTATED.\nI'm sure you feel used, cuz hon, you were. I was too. It's so hard to accept people who purposely use and hurt others.\n\nHe got what he wanted. Just what he wanted. A priceless jewel such as yourself so he could brag about it and add it to his collection of stuff he's done. I'm really sorry about it. And he could've cared, a little, but a little doesn't repair the damage. A little doesn't make him love you. A little doesn't make him want to marry you.\n\nI wish more than anything that things had worked out with my first one. I was 24 and a virgin, also, and loved him with all my heart and thought he was "the one". I'd promised myself that I would NEVER have sex with a man unless I knew he was the one I'd marry and that I fully trusted.\nMan do I ever regret giving in to this man!\n\nIt's not rape, even if they keep persistently trying to get it from you and you say no over and over again and then finally give in. It's the giving in part that makes it not rape. If he takes it from you without your consent, and if he takes it from you after threats or force, then it's rape.\nI've been there, done that before too (I didn't do the rape, it was the other way around).\n\nAnyway, good luck honey. I totally feel your pain!!!!

The survey, released this week, points out several disparities based on lifestyle, beliefs and political persuasion:\n\n•Republicans are happier than Democrats. \n•People who worship frequently are happier than those who don't. \n•The rich are happier than the poor. \n•Whites and Hispanics are happier than blacks. \n•Married people are happier than the unmarried. \n•Dog owners and cat owners rate the same. \n•Sunbelt residents are happier than everyone else. \n\nAbout 45 percent of Republicans said they were very happy, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. Republicans have been happier in surveys going back to 1972, the Pew study notes. \n\nThe reason might seem obvious, since "Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and—as we've already discovered—people who have more money tend to be happier," the report states.\n\nBut even after adjusting for income, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats. \n\nWhat about religion? \n\nForty-three percent of people who attend religious services weekly or more say they're very happy compared to 26 percent of those who go seldom or never. The Pew analysis does not answer the question of how religion, Republicanism and happiness might be related, however.\n\n\n\nStarcameo, I pasted the entire article based on this Pew Research study on happiness which is almost 2 months old. If you assume that people who attend church more often are people of faith, then we are happier.\n\nGod bless.

Yes, every single one of my siblings have aggravated me at one point or another in my life. To think of it, so have my parents, my husband, my friends, my child, the lady that drove to slow today, the man had too many items in the express lane, and the salesperson that had to tell me the style I wanted was sold out. Lots of people and things have aggravated me. You learn to deal with it as you get older. Smile and realize that in the end you are responsbile for your emotions and thoughts.

I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it. Here are the things I’ve found that help the most.\n\n1. Don't take the sleeping pills. Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too. This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested. If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep. For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.\n\n2. Try to go to bed at about the same time every night. You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.\n\n(Which somewhat contradicts:)\n\n3. If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy. Note - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep. So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM. \n\n4. Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep. If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while. Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to online debates. \n\n5. When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task. Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task. This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .\n\nThose are the most useful suggestions I have. Other things you can try:\n\nBefore you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down. I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be to wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep. \n\nGet plenty of exercise, but not right before bed. (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)\n\nAnother suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing\n\nSex *grin* by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.

People tend to fear that which they do not understand, or which challenges their preconcieved notions about their world. This is particularly true for those who are insecure in their avowed "beliefs," which are actually nothing more than "inherited" beliefs from their parents. The unexamined faith is actually no faith at all. It's almost axiomatic that the more insecure people are in their own faith, the more hostile they are to the faiths of others.\n\nThat's why they seem to be afraid of you, and why they seem antagonistic: you call into question beliefs about which they themselves are insecure.

motor skill development occurs without the use of "self talk," in other words, when we first learn of the spatial relationship and interaction between body movement and our environment, we typically do not form this understanding with language. it has been hypothesized that the same language independent areas of the brain that are vitally important for gross and fine motor development could be the same neurological mechanisms or processes activated when solving mathematical tasks or basic comprehension of the laws of physics, because these areas are known to be significantly intact and functional in patients who are without linguistic capability.

The psychology of the matter is this. Because when people are on the internet, there is no face to face communication. They can remain as anonymous as they desire. Hence such persons feel none of the inhibitions that are normally imposed by society on what is considered proper etiquette in conversation. Besides receiving rude words in return, there is no fear of severe consequences such as getting their face busted, nor do they have to see the facial expressions of the hurt they cause. Most people like this have poorly developed social skills to begin with. Either they are boorish cads, and their behavior is amplified by the nature of the internet, or they have pent-up anger that they are afraid to display in public, and lash out on the internet. People like this need to be dealt with firmly, but as the Scriptures say, "answer a fool according to his folly, answer not a fool according to his folly." In other words, expose such people as they fools they are, without resorting to their their tactics.

Stars do move, as well as rise and set along the horizon just as the sun and moon do.\n\nStars, just like objects in out solar system, orbit the center of their galaxies. However, most stars are just too far away to tell any discernible movement from day to day.\n\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis during the course of the night, stars will appear to rise and set on the horizon. If you have a camera with the capability of a very long exposure, you take a picture of the sky over the course of a few hours. When the picture is developed, you wont see just points of light, but rather streaks across the sky as the stars moved every so slightly.\nAlso, as the Earth revolves around the run throughout the year, certain stars become visible and others not based on out position in the solar system. Some constellations can only be seen during the summer/winter since the Earth is located on the opposite side of the sun during those times.
It should be okay, dear. But i confess I would feel awkward. Maybe you could take it as a fashion. Who knows you might start a trend!

So many questions...\nThe human brain has its limits. It's restricted by the brain's cooling system. The more we think the more we use energy, which creates heat, which has to be dissipated.\nAlso the neurons have to be fed. Cheetos has the most brain food per pound. That's why "Geeks" favor them so much.\nTo answer the other questions: The human brain is very slow in linear speed, but quick due to the trillions of parrallel connections of dendrites. Some of this technology will be applied to computers, but the computers will be able to work much faster. At some point the computers will out-think our human brains.\nYour idea of connecting the computers to our brains using blue tooth is a good one. It will enable us to increase our thinking by an unlimited amount. Thus the smart will become smarter and the dumb will become dumber. This will create an even bigger gap in our society. Some humans will be relagated to slavery, while others will live the life of Riley.

You can start looking as early as your sophomore year but I would recommend mid junior year to beginning senior year. It will also depend on what kind of scholarship you are applying for and what the requirements are. Things like essay contests and other scholarship awards such as that you can apply for anytime however some require specific grades (i.e. first semester senior year, final grades, etc.) or even want to know the specific school that you are applying to. Its never too early to start looking though and seeing what the requirements are. Apply to any that you are eligable.

Anyone can take classes at a community college without a high school diploma. Only very smart students can be accepted to a university without a diploma through "early admission" (that is, if the university offers this option), and then the high school requirements are completed using the college classes. \n\nSince you are not proficient in writing English, you can check out your options at your local community college, where you will need to pass proficiency tests before taking college level classes.

The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, respectively, in the sense that the length of time elapsed between sunrise and sunset on this day is a maximum for the year. Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.

only water weight, the only way to actually lose fat weight is by doing cardovascular exercise, so running, biking, swimming, rollerblading. Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart. These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without. Then work to there. Remember these are perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it. If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day. Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

In addition to the "ninja" type methods of recon, or ambush. Both are elite soldiers, but have very different missions. Green berets actual name is "Special Forces".

When I was younger at my Grandma and PaPa's house. They lived about 7 hours away from us. My Grandma would spend all day cooking and baking everything from scratch. My Aunt and Uncle would be there. We would sneak in the kitchen and we would try to get some of the crispy skin off the turkey and my Grandma would come rushing over hitting us in the rear end with her wooden spoon trying to get us out of the kitchen. It was always like a game we would play. She would fill up that small wooden table full of food. When they finally got too old to stay by themselves they finally came to live with us. It was never the same after that. I lost my Grandma 4 1/2 yrs ago and lost my Mom 1 year ago. Now Thankgiving has been a bit hard on me. I am trying to start traditions on my own. I will always have fond memories of my Grandma in her little red checkered apron, cooking over her old fashioned stove, and the air filling up with the most delicious smells in the world. My Grandma put the Spice of Love in everything she cooked and no one will ever cook as well as she did.

Milk thistle is used to treat inflammatory liver ailments, especially chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Gallbladder ailments and related digestive symptoms, varicose and spider veins problems in the legs and jaundice are helped by milk thistle treatment, as well. A silymarin injection is an antidote to poisoning from the "death cap" mushroom, amanita.\n\nTherapeutic Effect\n The active ingredient in milk thistle seeds is silymarin, a combination of three different flavonoids that supports the walls of liver cells, preventing poisons from penetrating them. It also stimulates the regeneration of these cells. Bitter principles and amino acids help support the entire digestive system.\n\nSilymarin as a liver tonic\n People with acute liver problems should follow a six-week treatment with tea made from milk thistle seeds (below, in healing tea mixtures) several times a year. This tea treatment program is often recommended for people with liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake and cirrhosis.\n\nHow silymarin works\n Silymarin helps prevent liver poisoning in two ways. It changes the liver cell walls in such a way that it is very difficult for poisons, such as cabon tetrachloride, to penetrate the walls. Silymarin also stimulates cell division so that new liver cells will grow continually.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMethods of Administration\nTea\n For poor digestion, drink this tea 30 min. before meals. To support blood vessel integrity for the treatment of spider or varicose veins, drink 2-3 cups of tea throughout the day.\nPour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 tsps. of crushed seeds. Steep 10-15 min. and strain. There is no time limit on treatment with this tea; its use may be ongoing. \n Peppermint increases the effectiveness of milk thistle tea and improves its taste. When you make the tea, add 1 tbsp. of peppermint leaves to the mixture.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTincture\n For gallstones or other gallbladder concerns, take 20-30 drops up to 3 times daily until the condition improves. To prepare the tincture, mix ¼ cup of crushed seeds with 1¼ cups of rum in a clean glass jar. Cover tightly and shake well. Let stand for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days. Strain out the seeds and bottle the liquid. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutritional Supplement\n To support good liver function, eat 1 tbsp. of ground seeds daily. In a coffee grinder or spice mill, grind seeds to add to hot cereals, muffins, rice dishes and other whole-grain meals. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedicinal Uses\nTincture for intensive treatment\n Silymarin is only partly water soluble, so for an intensive treatment to protect and regenerate liver cells, you should also use a tincture made from milk thistle seeds to increase the effect of the tea. Put 10 drops of the tincture into 1 cup of milk thistle tea. This tincture can also be purchased in health food stores. Caution: Because of its alcohol content, never use the tincture if you are suffering from acute liver inflammation or alcoholism.\n\nLeaf tea for aiding digestion\n You can also make therapeutic teas from the leaves of the milk thistle. They do not contain silymarin, but they have an overall positive effect on the liver and gallbladder, and a tea made with them is valuable for improving digestion and for easing mild digestive complaints. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1½ tsp. of finely chopped leaves. Steep for 5-10 min. and then strain. Drink 2-3 glasses per day.\n\nCompresses for varicose veins\n The external application of the tea in a compress can help varicose veins and open leg sores. Make the tea; cool. Soak a cloth in the cooled tea and apply as a damp compress

I had a similar problem during my first Master's Degree. I have straight A's for it, except for one C, in an "elective." There was a professor who didn't give us information on how we were doing until the day before the official allowable withdrawl date, then encouraged us to re-write our test and gave out better grades for it rather than withdraw. However, he had a thing against people from my particular major, and after stringing us along gave me (oh joy) the highest grade from my department.... a C. The other students got D's and F's. However, people giving similar responses from other departments got A's and B's. After this, my department changed it's recommended electives for my type of degree to a similar course taught elsewhere. My department head, after reviewing my situation, accepted the course for the elective credit needed toward my degree (the policy for a Master's level was an A or B only) so that I could just move on and not worry about it. I still feel awfully annoyed, though.\n\nIf you have copies of your work, and your professor's comments on them, take it to your department head or college dean, and ask them to look into the situation.

A train is moving from station A to station B; the distance between them is 10km.\n\nWhen the distance is 2m from station A, a man at station A will say that the train is 2km from A; whereas the man at B will say that the train is at 8km.\n\nTherefore, relative to man at A, the distance is 2km and relative to the man at B the distance is 8km.\n\nThis is called relativity.\n\nIn Physics we measure the quantities like mass, length and time.\n\nThese quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is at rest.\n\nThe same quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is set up in a fast moving train.\n\nWill the observations will be the same or different?\n\nThe theory of relativity deals about such things.

Being dumped means that your ex thinks someone else is better than you. You need to look in the mirror and decide if it's objectively true, or whether your ex is mentally ill.\n\nIf it's true, then work on being a more desirable man. If it's false, then smile, because your ex has screwed up and she will eventually regret her decision -- only it will be too late, because you will find someone better than her.\n\nThe actual feeling of love sickness is a biological condition which is the product of hormonal secretions which you cannot easily control. Eventually it wears off, and it will wear off faster if you stay away from your ex, and put away any memories of her (especially things that smell from her scent -- odors will cause the hormone levels to rise quicker than anything else, and it will make you miserable).\n\nSo, there's both a mental and a physiological component to the situation. You have to decide without any question on the mental part, because until you do, you will be unhappy. The physical part will take care of itself if you just stay away.

A Celeron is any of a large number of different budget x86 microprocessors produced by Intel and marketed as a budget/value CPU line. The Celeron family complements Intel's higher-performance (and more expensive) Pentium CPUs family. Introduced in April 1998, the first Celeron was based on the Pentium II core. Later versions were based on the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Pentium M. These processors are suitable for most applications, but their performance is somewhat limited when it comes at running intense applications, such as cutting edge games or graphical modeling programs, especially when compared to that of their high-end counterparts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe new chip family, which includes the processor formerly known by the code name Banias, was designed to help manufacturers build notebooks that use less power and offer extended battery life, along with better wireless networking capabilities. Instead of just giving Banias a variation on the company's well-known Pentium moniker, Intel decided to set the family of chips apart with a completely new name. A few insiders at Intel had been jokingly referring to the Banias chip as Mobilium, but Intel will call the new chip itself Pentium-M. Intel says the Centrino name, and a new logo that goes with it, suggest flight and mobility. The name is a blend of the words "center" and "neutrino," the company said. (A Google search on "centrino" also reveals the term to be a common one in Italian embroidery circles.) "The Centrino brand signifies a new generation of mobile PCs that will change where and how people compute," Pam Pollace, vice president and director of Intel's corporate marketing group, said in a statement. The Centrino family will also include chipsets, which handle data inside a PC, and wireless radio modules designed to allow new notebooks to use 802.11 wireless networking.

Show them what a cool teacher you are! Get them to look past it. If that won't work, and if you have to....Write stuff on the board, hand them out papers and let them do it on their own. Don't teach, If they don't understand it, it's their problem. That will teach them a lesson to not mess with the teacher. Or you could write them up, or send them to the principals.

Definitely. This team has hot streaks and cold streaks, and if they get hot at the right time, you can bet they'll be a contender in the NCAA tournament. Plus, they almost made it last year, losing in the Elite 8, so I'd say look out for the Mountaineers in 2006!

Join the club buddy! You seem to be one of the guys that seem to arouse the gay feelings in supposedly straight guys!\n\nI am a member of that elite group myself. Actually most of the boyfriends I had identify themselves as straight. Unfortunately, they freak out when their feelings towards you move from the lust slot to the romance slot. They usually bolt out of the door before you know what has happened.\n\nHuman sexuality is ever so complicated. No one can give you a straight answer on this issue, pun intended! ;)

You are correct. The tracks are powered by cogged wheels driven by the engine and work like the wheels of a car except they run along the track instead of the road bed. Look at the wheel when it is moving. The bottom point is momentarily fixed to the ground and the top point is moving straight ahead with a momentary velocity. The axel which is half way between the top and bottom is traveling at the average velocity:\n\nVelocity (axel) = (Vtop + Vbottom)/ 2 = (Vtop + 0)/2 = 1/2 Vtop\n\nThe machine moves at the speed of the axel; proving your point.\n\nAn even better illusion is the fact that when a locomotive speeds down a track, part of it is always moving backwards (hint: the part of the wheel flanges below the top surface of the track!).

You must mean universe, not galaxy.\n\nWe live on planet Earth, which is in a solar system. A solar system consists of a star (we call ours the sun), planets which orbit the star, and maybe other debris and gases. Solar systems are in galaxies. Our galaxy is the Milky Way. It's a barred spiral galaxy and it's a big one. Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. That means, traveling at the speed of light, it'd take you 100,000 years to get from one side to the other if you went straight across the disk.\n\nOutside of the galaxy is mainly empty space (heck, galaxies have trillions of stars and massive clouds of dust and gases and most of it is still mainly empty space). There may be rogue stars or junk that got flug out of a galaxy here and there but they're generally few.\n\nDoes the universe have a boundary? Probably, but the nature of it probably isn't anything we'd be familiar with...not like a wall or anything. Can we ever get there? No, we are well within the universe and even if we could travel the speed of light and live forever, it's thought the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate so we'd still never get to the edge, and if by change we mysteriously appeared at the edge and move along with it, there may be some physical process which would prevent us from realizing it.
yes, it does. \n\nhere's how evaporation works: the molecules of the water are bouncing around and colliding with each other, randomly changing direction and speed all the time. when one molecule near the surface randomly gets a kick towards the surface (if it's moving fast enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonding) it will exit the condensed water and literally come shooting out of the liquid and into the air. \n\nthe reverse process (condensation) happens at the same time - water molecules in the atmosphere will randomly go shooting into the surface of the liquid, where they are captured by water's hydrogen bonds. if the air is humid enough, this will happen at the same rate as evaporation and the result will be called a dynamic equilibrium - water is evaporating and condensing in equal amounts and the water level will appear static.\n\nanyway, if you turn the temperature of the water up, the molecules move faster. this is how we interpret the meaning of temperature on the microscopic level. so, faster-moving molecules are more likely to overcome the hydrogen bonding, and therefore more often escape the water's surface, which results in faster evaporation.
Dude, there's so many jobs available with that. \nFirst off, master's degree in biotech can go for any research position involving medicine, biology, or chemistry.

there is four statements.\n \n(1) Everything that is thrown upward will fall on the earth because earth is the home of everything. \n\n(2)the speed of fall of an object is proportional to its weight. \n\n(3)An object dropped on air has faster rate of fall than in water because of the resisting force of the medium(air or water) \n\n(4) Natural motion causes violent motion
It applies directly to DC and only sort of to AC.\n\nThe problem with AC is the power. If you drive a perfect inductor or capacitor, you will have voltage and current, but no power. In real life, the load of an AC circuit has both reactance (capacitive or inductive) and resistance, so there will be power drawn, but in a more complex manner than simply P=IE.\n\nThe load is complex also, the inductance and capacitance are 180 degrees out of phase with each other and 90 degrees out of phase with a real (resistive) load. So when you add them you need to use trigonometry.\n\nDon't even ask about RF circuits. It is another order of magnitude higher in difficulty.

TPCASTT is a way of analyzing a poem.\nSee the link below for how it works.\n\nT-Title - what does title mean *before* you read the poem.\nP-Paraphrase - put the poem in your own words.\nC-Connotation - what meanings are implied?\nA-Attitude - what is tone or attitude of speaker & poet?\nS-Shift - poem shifts, changes, develops\nT-Title - after reading, does title have other meanings?\nT-Theme - what *might* the poet be saying here?\n\nSo this is all about "critical thinking" -- teachers do not care about what YOU think about a poem. The purpose is to teach YOU to think and analyze.\n\nThe grand irony here is that TPCASTT is a formula and as Robert Frost wrote:\n\n>>\nYou get more credit for thinking if you restate formulae or cite cases that fall in easily under formulae, but all the fun is outside saying things that suggest formulae that won't formulate - that almost but don't quite formulate.\n>>

I agree with you that he is a great photographer. Here is what I found out about him:\n\nMONTE ZUCKER - Transcending Time\nFew people know who Monte Zucker is today. He keeps reinventing himself. Photographs that he continually creates ...some within just the past few weeks ... carry his unmistakable signature only if you know his signature style.\nMonte's images are simple, direct, and emotional. Each of them makes a simple statement. There is nothing in his photographs, except what should be there. All distractions were removed before he snapped the shutter. What you see is what he wants you to see. It's usually a face or a collection of faces. When It's a photograph of an individual, you will immediately know that person. When It's a photograph of a group you'll feel and experience their involvement with each other.\nBased on classical tradition, Monte's portraiture has never strayed far from his original intent - to capture a moment in people's lives and memorialize it for posterity, In his own words, "I don't photograph the world as it is. I photograph the world as I would like it to be."\nTo accomplish this goal, Monte seems to always capture the moment with little or no direction. Although he basically controls all of his subjects when they're being photographed, they appear to be completely natural. \nHe's always at the right place at the right time to do that. It's because of his steadfast determination to photograph people at their best angles and in their best light that he's able to continually come up with photographs that the subjects feel are the best picture that they've ever had taken of themselves. Of course, the fact that he's spent over 50 years as a professional photographer/teacher studying and perfecting his photographic technique may have something to do with his success.\nMonte has achieved just about every photographic degree that exists. The United Nations recently honored him as Portrait Photographer of the Year 2002. He feels that his most special honor, however, is the fact that his popularity with photographers of all ages is continually growing.

I have an answer to this question. \n\nThe Christian Gospels mention Mary Magdalene a few times, with some confusion as to whether she and Mary of Bethany are the same person. Mary Magdalene is the only woman mentioned by name in all four gospels besides Mother Mary. She sinned more deeply, so she had more demons to eject. The number seven gives the clue.\n \nJesus healed Mary Magdalene of seven demons (Mark 16:9, Luke 8:2); Mary Magdalene came to the dinner at Simeon's house with an alabaster jar from which she anointed the head and feet of Jesus Christ (Mark 14:3-9, John 11:2, 12:3-8); and Mary Magdalene was the first to see Jesus Christ resurrected from the tomb (John 20, Mark 16:9, Matthew 28).

I don't know if anyone's heard of this guy but a man named Alvin Toffler explained it all in a book called The Third Wave. \n\nHe explains that we are in our third wave of history which is the age of technology and learning. The first wave was an agricultural based society and the second wave was an industry based society. \n\nWell, since we jump from each wave of history so quickly, people experience something called future shock. This is a term to describe a sort of disorientation fromn too much change in too short a period of time. \n\nSo basically, that's why so many adults are overwhelmed by computers and have to ask the younger egneration to explain how to use them. Because, we are in a an age of technology, it's very rare to see people reading anymore. People used to read constantly and now most people only read for educational purposes insread of for pleasure. We rely onj technology to do all the dirty work for us. Calculators, computers, are great examples of this. \n\nMy history teacher was telling us that less than 100 years ago the average high school senior had a vocablary of about 40,000 words. In our stupid society today, the average high school senior has a vocabulary of about 20,000 words. What happened to the lost 20,000 words? Yeah, we are allowing our selves to become more and more moronic.

It might help to explain the process of defragmenting. When your computer is new files are saved whole and your free space is one contiguous area. As files are saved, deleted, saved again, and so on, the free space on your hard drive becomes divided into little chunks. When new files are saved into those chunks they must be divided and saved as several smaller pieces and then reassembled when accessed. Obviously when your computer has to grab several pieces of a file from different places and reassemble it, that is slower.\n\nDefragmenting rearranges the files on your hard drive so that they are saved whole and in one place. It also makes your free space into a single continous area.\n\nData on a CD or DVD is permanent, that is to say you cannot move or delete it. Therefore you cannot defragment them. In fact you don't need to for the same reasons.
There are several, some of them are:\nAssaults, burglary, criminal damage to property, using a motor vehicle without the ownes permission, issuing bad checks, bribery, robbery, bigamy, incest, harassment, etc
No.
If you're talking strictly telegraph, then it's just the tapping of metal on metal.\n\nEvery time the sender presses the key down, he closes an electrical circuit and when he releases the key, it breaks the circuit. It's similar to flipping the light switch on and off.\n\nIf the sender's key is down, it sends electricity through the telegraph wires to the receiver. The electricity energizes an electric-magnet, which pulls down a small hammer on the receiver's side. This results in a "tap" sound. When the sender releases the key, the electricity is shut off, cutting power to the electric-magnet. A spring then pulls the hammer back up to its starting position where it's ready to tap again when the sender presses the key.
Yes, there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes. Both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth. The moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans, affecting weight of water over portions of the earth. The moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway. Of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun's light relative to the positions of the sun, moon and earth. Because the ocean tides (and crustal tides) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon), the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel's back.

If you are young, you have "plumbing " that works as good as it gets. However as you age valves don't work as well, cholesterol build-up takes it's toll and the "pipe" doesn't fill as well.

Of course, for the most part, a new GF will do the same trick if the damage isn't too bad!\n\nAnd no....it does not increase the libido or sex drive....it aids in the functioning of a man's equipment!
You've got some good suggestions so far (and some pretty crappy answers too). \n\n1. Make sure that there is a long round of foreplay. The more excited and relaxed he is, the easier it will be. \n\n2. Use plenty of lube. Infact, I would say, that you cannot use too much lube.\n\n3. Try (gently) opening up the area with something smaller than what you're currently using: for example if you're trying to use your penis right now, start with a finger first. It's smaller and will go in easier. After awhile of that, he should be reader for bigger objects.\n\n4. Make sure that you're relaxed also. If he can sense that you're getting frustrated or impatient, that will carry over to him and make the experience difficult for you both, physically and emotionally.\n\n5. Check into literature and instructional references about this. The only one I've ever heard of is "Bend Over Boyfriend," but I'm sure there are many others. Look into this together, it will be a unifying activity and give him confidence and reassurance, which will translate into being more relaxed during sex. \n\n6. Make sure to make these experiences enjoyable, even if you don't reach your "goal" right away make sure that the experience is not a waste.\n\nHope this helps. Have fun!\n\nFR

I prefer a staff. I'm too clumsy for a lightsaber...I'd just end up hurting myself. A wand is extremely tempermental, if not handled correctly, and I suspect I'd blow things up a lot more often than not. A staff, on the other hand, has three things going for it:\n\n1. It looks cool, in a "don't mess with me, I'm a mountain man" kind of way.\n2. It can be used to beat people without killing them, even aside from its magical content.\n3. Finally, the word "Staff" sounds way cooler and tougher than "wand" (which sounds like something a magical fairy would carry) and "light saber" (which sounds a little too much like the fruity, ring-shaped pocket candy).

The issue is not the Mexicans, it's the illegal immigrants comining into the USA via the Mexican BORDER.Illegally crossing the border is a FEDERAL offense, a felony. - The issue is ILLEGAL immigrants, not LEGAL immigrants -They are hired by businesses in our country, the businesses should be prosecuted for hiring illegals \n-They pay lower wages to the illegal immigrants than they once paid the American worker, thus American worker wages fall -Americans would do the jobs at the fair wage the businesses formerly paid them. -There is no job they do that Americans won't do. When they say they work harder than Americans, that is a racist remark. Plus, Americans worked to build and keep this land, we didn't run to another country crying with our hand held out. We have stamina and PRIDE. -Illegal immigrants abuse our govrnment assistance programs that were meant for the citizens of the USA when they fall on hard times, not illegal immigrants\n-They can't afford doctors so they glut the ER of hospitals to seek medical care -Our forefathers built this country. Some were illegal, that was then, this is now. We now have immigration laws that are to be abided by, we didn't then\n-Our country fought the Mexican-American war and WON, then paid $15 million dollars for that land and for the privilege of whooping the Mexicans a$$e$ -The illegal immigrant worker is only a tip of the iceberg of problems to come, brought by the illegals coming across the border. They want "conquista" (reconquor), they'll tell you that. They want that land we whooped their butts for, they can't accept defeat. -They flew their flags in protest of the USA, the very country that has been putting food on their table -they bring in their drugs and gangs.\n-They disrespect the people of the USA and our leaders. They should be deported and the sooner the better. Our borders should be tightened up and patrolled with armed guards. America needs to wake up. You may or may not agree with me, but be sure you know ALL the reasons for wanting the illegals OUT.

Adding a question mark to three words does not in and of itself form a question. Try again.
The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\n\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \n\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\n\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\n\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\n\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\n\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \n\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed "From your Valentine."\n\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \n\n:-)

Think about which makes more sense. \n\nSome liberal lunatic who has too much time and weed on his hands \n\n- or -\n\nSome religious zealot lunatic who attempted to destroy the towers in 1993, declares war and death to all Americans (praise be with us, [just to piss off the muslims]) TWICE between 1993 & 2001 who comes back with a new and improved plan, which he trained people to carry out and particiapte in. \n\nHmm, pass the weed while we talk about it.
First thing you do is make an appointment to your M.D. At your age the symptoms you've mentioned has to be taken very seriously. You don't want to end up with untreated diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, immune system disorder etc.,Yahoo people are great ,but you need professional advice.
For me, the dealbreakers are:\n\n- compassion. I've only ever dated one woman who actually asked what was bothering me when I was clearly distraught.\n- intelligence. Many guys prefer a woman that can't challenge them, but I get a weird pervy feeling from dating women that are easy to manipulate.\n- wit. I have to enjoy talking to her if I'm to do it every day for the rest of my life.\n- bonus points: humour. If she can make me laugh, that's huge. Being playfully affectionate is pretty much a guaranteed A+.
I believe Mr.Ramanpillai is right.He started his career in politics long back and was the man behind the birth and growth of that party in Kerala and didnt went anywhere for better income as BJP didnt have any power anywhere.\nMr.Mukundan is very clever politician and it is heard that he earned 18 crores during the petrol pump scams.\nLet Mr.Pillai say evrything in press club and sometimes he can save the party by that way!!

No passion is shown by different people in diffent ways and it's also recieved by different people in different ways. Some people are more passionate holding someone then kissing them and visa versa, when your passionate you feel it let your body take over forget about how fast or slow you are going, let your body do it for you.

A herniated disk is a rupture of the intervertebral disc of the spine. When this occurs, the cushion that sits between the spinal vertebra is pushed outside its normal position. A herniated disc would not be a problem so often if it weren't for the spinal nerves that are very close to the edge of the intervertebral disc.

Aphasia, a total or partial loss of the ability to use words, sometimes is quickly and completely cured after a stroke. Since your case has been for a number of years, it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary. To date, treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading, writing, and comprehension skills. Speech pathologists and neurologists would be best trained to help you recover. You should certainly contact a neurologist for more treatment information. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.\n\nOn a more global level, there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage. A number of studies have shown that those who think more or are involved in more intelletually challenging tasks are less at risk for Alzheimer's disease, for example. This may very well be true for stroke patients. Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can. Best of luck.

It angers me to read the level of intellect in these answers. The Earth is speeding at such a rate not felt by us (minute earthlings) on the surface. The wobble is caused by the fact that the earths rotation is still trying to balance out from it's original creation. Due to the fact that the Earths' mantle is still constantly moving under intense pressure, and made up of molten rock, the weight of the world is not level.

Artificial Insemination (spelled correctly there) would be your best bet. In AI, you could be the carrier of the baby and have the sperm of your hubby/partner harvested and inserted into you. There is another kind of option in AI wherein both the egg and the sperm is harvested in both partners but a 3rd party will carry the baby if the female egg-donor is incapable of carrying the child herself. \n\nOf course, adoption would be another option.

I would recommend taking the ACT at least once to see if you can get a better score.\n\nIf you are classified as resident, then you should definitely apply as a freshman. Don't exclude yourself prematurely by forfeiting your freshmen application and going directly to a community college. You can always decide to attend a community college after you are accepted or rejected. You can find out more about residency here: http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Residency/legalinfo.html\n\nThe UC should only look at your two highest SAT II scores. I believe if you are not majoring in hard core science, your low chem test score should not have any significant impact.\n\nAny student applying to the College of Letter and Science is competing against other students applying to the College, regardless of the chosen major. So it doesn't matter if you apply to Molecular and Cell Biology or Philosophy, the competition is the same.\n\nConcentrate on doing well in your AP courses but don't feel pressured to take the AP exam if you are not confident. Not taking the AP exam does not count against you in the application process. Scoring well on your exam (4 or 5), however, will give you a small advantage. Take the ACT before December and submit the score, the UC will only look at the highest combine score regardless of how many times you've taken the tests.\n\nMost importantly, focus your energy on producing a well-written personal essay. You can find a guidelines on writing your personal essays from Berkeley: http://students.berkeley.edu/files/Admissions/Personal_State_07.pdf\n\nFor your essay, please: 1) do not submit what you wrote for the "college essay" assignment for your senior English class; 2) do not have your fellow students or your teachers proofread it; instead, ask your parents' coworkers or friends, someone who doesn't know you very well to give you feedback and proofread. The reason is that the essay is supposed to give the admissions officers a complete picture of who you are, what you have done, and where you want to go/how you want to get there. Only someone who doesn't know you very well can evaluate whether your essay has accomplished that.
The State Dept. of Education. They require that each district follow curriculum that is set by the state which are minimum basic standards. Each respective school district's Board of Education then adds a curriculum of their own, as long as they have at least what the state requires.

No, because we Brits look after our own affairs - hence the movement by the SNP and Plaid Cymru to have him impeached under our legal system.

Wouldn't it be worse if you had sex with him and then broke up and you found out that was all he had been waiting for? I'm sorry, I know that it hurts to break up but don't let that be influenced by the whole sex question. You made a very personal choice to wait to have sex and that choice is still just as valid today as it was before. It is still something special that you will be able to share with the guy of your dreams one day.

Simple....\n\nA CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory) is a drive which reads aluminum-coated round plastic discs, however does not write to the discs. Invented in the United States on 1972, the CD-ROM standard was officially introduced in 1982 when Philips and Sony agreed on the 4.72-inch size format we now use today. Later, as Phillips and Sony continued cooperation in the 1980s, additional specifications were announced concerning the use of CD technology for computer data which evolved into computer CD-ROM drives used today.\n\nThe CD-ROM diskettes are 12 x 12 cm with a width of .1cm, as shown in the above picture. The disc is made of a polycarbonate wafer and is coated with a metallic film, usually an aluminum alloy. This aluminum film is the portion of the disc that the CD-ROM drive reads for information. The aluminum film (strata) is then covered by a plastic polycarbonate coating that protects the underlying data. A label will usually be placed on the top of the disc and data is read from the bottom of the CD.

I wish it wasnt with him seein the fact that we are no longer even in contact but at the time i was in love with him and still have alot of feelings for him even though he was always in trouble and not well liked.

About this Site Basic Islamic Beliefs What's New \nMuslims Today History & Civilizations Schools & Family Life \nWomen in Islam Women of Afghanistan Companions of Mohammed \nConverts to Islam Islamic Books & Media Links \n Join our mailing list Search this site \n \n\n \n \n \n\n Islam, Culture and Women\nby Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood\n\nHow can anyone justify Islam's treatment of women, when it imprisons Afghans under blue shuttlecock burqas and makes Pakistani girls marry strangers against their will? \n\nHow can you respect a religion that forces women into polygamous marriages, mutilates their genitals, forbids them to drive cars and subjects them to the humiliation of "instant" divorce? In fact, none of these practices are Islamic at all. \n\nAnyone wishing to understand Islam must first separate the religion from the cultural norms and style of a society. Female genital mutilation is still practised in certain pockets of Africa and Egypt, but viewed as an inconceivable horror by the vast majority of Muslims. Forced marriages may still take place in certain Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, but would be anathema to Muslim women from other backgrounds. \n\nIndeed, Islam insists on the free consent of both bride and groom, so such marriages could even be deemed illegal under religious law. \n\nA woman forbidden from driving a car in Riyadh will cheerfully take the wheel when abroad, confident that her country's bizarre law has nothing to do with Islam. Afghan women educated before the Taliban rule know that banning girls from school is forbidden in Islam, which encourages all Muslims to seek knowledge from cradle to grave, from every source possible. \n\nThe Koran is addressed to all Muslims, and for the most part it does not differentiate between male and female. Man and woman, it says, "were created of a single soul," and are moral equals in the sight of God. Women have the right to divorce, to inherit property, to conduct business and to have access to knowledge. \n\nSince women are under all the same obligations and rules of conduct as the men, differences emerge most strongly when it comes to pregnancy, child-bearing and rearing, menstruation and, to a certain extent, clothing. \n\nSome of the commands are alien to Western tradition. Requirements of ritual purity may seem to restrict a woman's access to religious life, but are viewed as concessions. During menstruation or postpartum bleeding, she may not pray the ritual salah or touch the Koran and she does not have to fast; nor does she need to fast while pregnant or nursing. \n\nThe veiling of Muslim women is a more complex issue. Certainly, the Koran requires them to behave and dress modestly - but these strictures apply equally to men. Only one verse refers to the veiling of women, stating that the Prophet's wives should be behind a hijab when his male guests converse with them. \n\nSome modernists, however, claim that this does not apply to women in general, and that the language used does not carry the textual stipulation that makes a verse obligatory. In practice, most modern Muslim women appreciate attractive and graceful clothes, but avoid dressing provocatively. \n\nWhat about polygamy, which the Koran endorses up to the limit of four wives per man? The Prophet, of course, lived at a time when continual warfare produced large numbers of widows, who were left with little or no provision for themselves and their children. \n\nIn these circumstances, polygamy was encouraged as an act of charity. Needless to say, the widows were not necessarily sexy young women, but usually mothers of up to six children, who came as part of the deal. \n\nPolygamy is no longer common, for various good reasons. The Koran states that wives need to be treated fairly and equally - a difficult requirement even for a rich man. Moreover, if a husband wishes to take a second wife, he should not do so if the marriage will be to the detrimen

From a guys point of view, I would say to tell him the truth and don't hold back anything. Anything not told will eventually end up hurting the both of you. Depending on how he accepts the facts you tell him, will determine whether there is a future for you two. Telling in person is better because you can tell if that person is lying or how he accepts the news by body language.
It all depends on the size of the penis. The female will definitely have some pain and burning the first time. It's possible for the male to have a little pain from the vagina being tight on the female. If the female he has sex with isn't a virgin, then his feelings will be wonderful.
My suggestion for learning java is always the same... pick up a copy of Teach Yourself Java in 21 days, and code every program in there. Mess with them. Change them to do different things. Combine a bunch of them to do something cool.

Since the current version has been out for a while, you might be able to find it used somewhere, too.

You should tell her in person. It doesn't have to be confrontational. Just say your personalities don't mix. Tell her you don't like smoke (are you allergic to it?); you need your rest for class and her early morning (or late night) visitors disturb your sleep. If you are afraid she will interrupt you, you can always write it in a letter.

Because big cats have PRIDE. (Gnuck, gnuck.)\n\nAnd it would really hurt if you were a little house cat and had to give birth to a lion. Ouch!\n\nIt's just a matter of language. English has all kinds of unusual terms for groups of animals, & there's not any logic to it. One way you could think of it is that the name for the group isn't organized around taxonomy (the scientific categorization of species). We'd say a "flock of seagulls" or a "flock of sheep," but a group of crows is, believe it or not, a "murder of crows."\n\nThe same kind of thing with what we call young animals. Goats have kids & people have kids. Your example is just one that works the opposite way, when like things are differentiated rather than clumped together.

Try using Google. search for 80's commercials. I came across a person selling many CD's of 70's and 80's commercials. I bought a set that contained Saturday Morning commercials.

While there is no real definition for what a actual hippie was, at least there wasn't in the day. People would get together I can remember and discuss who was an actual hippie and who wasn't. Now the older generation knew for sure that everone who wore their hair long was a for sure hippie, however that was not always the case. Where did they go, well they went from not trusting anybody over thirty to not trusting anybody below thirty,(seems to be a common age there),some became yuppies and all remain free spirts at heart. The hippies did not go anywhere they just became the establishment that they used to fight. It all comes full circle. Before hippies it was beatnik's each genaration has those that do not fit in to the common, but will always become as they age to perfection.
It is not out of the question to ask him what type of place you will be going for dinner so that you can dress appropriately and more along the lines of what he will be wearing. (Don't ask him what are you wearing?) If it is nice casual: You don't have to wear jeans, but down play the blouse if you are going to wear dress pants... be comfortable, yourself, and not too sexy. A little sexiness is usually more sexy than showing lots of skin. You can be classy sexy as opposed to the trashy version. If you can stand the jeans... I would say try it... add a nice blazer or blouse and some skinny heel sandals or pumps (trendy) and just make sure the face is flawless and the hair is hot and the jewelry is nice, nails nice... the shirt and the pants - won't matter. If you wear slacks... wear a jean jacket with a cute tank under it... makes it more casual, but still cute. Wow him with your interest in his conversation and how easy you are to talk to and have ongoing laughter and conversation. If you go out again... and you can get more dressed up for that wow him with something sexier and that way he is getting to see a different side to you. Make sure if you like this person that you can hold a conversation and that you come across intelligent about something.... he will be impressed, no matter if you are a waitress or a lawyer... if you are smart - it shows. Some men find it a turn on.
Such a stupid question..LMFAO
At my high school, they prefered us to take languages instead of technology because colleges around us stressed the importance of the four main subjects and foreign language (most colleges require at least two years of a foreign language.) However, if you're looking at a more technology based college, then it may be fine. It all depends on what you want to do and what the college wants.

Don't call him. Let him come get in touch with you.\n\nDo not wait around for him for a long while, either, miss. If he does not have the courtesy, decency, and maturity to speak with you about whatever may be troubling him about the current relationship situation, then honestly, you are better off without him. I know that sounds cold, but I feel that you will find it to be quite accurate later on.\n\nBest of luck. If he wants you, he'll call you. If not - brush yourself off, and find a guy who has good sense and enough maturity to talk to you about such matters.

I think the question should "Would you ever go hunting with Dick "dead eye" Cheney?" \nOkay like isn't he like almost legally blind? I thought he had some kind of heart condition? Do you think his rosatia is from age or booze?\nIs it real hunting when your stocked farm? Does hunting really shooting your mate?

Cardio is the best way to lose weight. Get moving and bring your heart rate up. Swimming, running, jogging, tennis, basketball, elliptical, cycling, step, kickboxing, etc. Anything like that will help you burn fat.\n\nYou can also do some weight training, lunges, squats, and crunches, etc. in addition to your cardio. This will put more muscle on your body, and the more muscle you have, the more fat your body burns from cardio.\n\nTry here and look under 'Exercise Pictures':\nhttp://www.ironworkout.com/index.htm
I guess the body would try the following:\na) try and get more water to increase blood volume to the possible extent\nb) collapse (decrease diameter of) the blood vessels to a small extent to decrease the overall volume available for the blood
First of all and if you want serious answers. I would expect this from an atheist. And the atheist wonder why they get a bad name?? Sexual perversion,murder,torture and you laugh. Oh well. Go ahead and laugh. You better laugh and enjoy now because your father has a ball and chain around your neck and when you finally get the reward he promised you(boy will you be surprised), it will be too late. You think you will laugh then also don't you? In answer to your question. If it did happen in the building where I worship with my fellow believers,I'd leave as fast as I could. But since this question was asked just to get a rise out of christians and it did cause a little stir,I'll say thanks for the 2 points..
This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I won’t have you on my top five list, huh?

Law enforcement officers are, as their name suggests, people entrusted by the government to enforce the law that government lays down. The key word in this case is entrusted. Even today, with terrorism, high security everywhere and political unrest, every facet of society is becoming more distrusting of the general public, who they suspect want to blow them up (talk about pathological paranoid schitzophrenia hey?), and these are the people in high positions of power. Trust takes a long time to develop, and so a chain of command has been established whereby the more dangerous and the longer time you spend serving the government's interests, the better the departments of that government will treat you, including law enforcement. There are likewise stereotype offenders in the gen. pop. that police target, for the same reason: less service to the gov't = worse treatment.\nThe point of all this is to emphasize that a government is not going to allow a law to be amended, changed or repealed that takes responsibility away from the people the gov't trusts, so that the gen. pop. is a little more comfortable.\nSo my answer then, is if you want something done that a powerful force is against, you need to be more powerful that that force, or atleast a threat to their sense of power. This means building gen. pop. support for your cause, not by petition (these are ignored without the following), and not with a public rally in a park that affects noone, but with actions that undermine the power that government wields over the gen. pop. and sending that message up the chain of command that they are losing control and must yield to your demands. Always remember, you are not at war with the government, they are not your enemy! you are revolting (starting a revolution) that will benefit both you and them, and you are asking assertively for their help in justifying such change. Guns, violence, aggression and injury/death will not solve anything; infact it will make it worse, escalating out of control where all concerned forget the point and just try to stay alive and out of jail (how did I get myself into this mess?). This is not only about improving crime - anticrime interaction procedures, but about maintaining societal peace. It's about sending a big message of popular dissatisfaction and unrest, not with handcuffs and cellbars. Play smart, not hard!

Isis is partly right. The word is "preppie." It means being in a clique of students in a public school (or in a private one), who are going on to college, as opposed to those who may not be. It comes from "preparatory school," which is usually a private one. Other cliques in a public school might be jocks (athletes) or goths (weird, dark-dressers). Preppie carries the meaning that the person is richer and/or more socially important than others. Some years ago, a young man caused the death ofa young woman in Central Park, New York City. It was called the Preppie Murder Case, because he was in a private preparatory school, and he claimed that she died because of "rough sex." So the word "preppie" carries a lot of emotional weight.

Two types of Spinal Anesthesaia are sub dural and epidural though he former is more or less considered synonymous with spinal. It Spreads along the subdural or epidural space depending on where it is adminsitered. and the nerve fibres exiting from the spinal cord are bathed in the fluids containing the anaethetic agent, which Blocks off the Soidum channels o n the surface membrane of th nerve fibres. which in turn prevent the transmission of nerve impulses by depolarisation via these nerve fibres. And your legs feel numb and heavy. The larger nerve fibres take longer to be affected than the smaler one. Hence you lose Sensations first then movement as motor nerve fibres are usually larger than pain/sensory fibres.
I looked a long time, through maybe 50-60 glossaries, trying to find a real estate definition for "hard corner" listed someplace.\n\nIn real estate, the closest I got was: A hard cost is an actual cost of construction. Hard money loan is a mortgage based primarily on the condition and value of the property. \n\nSome commercial real estate listings for sale use the term "hard corner" to describe their property. A hard corner, as it applies to real estate, seems to be a term used to describe a commercial real estate property located directly on a hard curbed corner. It is a corner lot located at a busy intersection. There can be a traffic signal at that intersection, or not. It is a desirable location.

I live in Miami. I am involved with a Cuban that is already here. \n\n\nI think that your answer has more to do with marrying an immigrant from a country that sucks instead of specifically "Cuban." \n\nIn general, such people may be more inclined to do what they have to do to get out of their sucky country. Will the person be grateful? Maybe. Can people learn to love? Maybe.\n\nThe biggest problem is that they were raised in horrible, communist dictatorship. Their value system and perspective on life is very different from you or at least what your question suggests -- a romantic, love based value system. \n\nThe United States is very wealthy and we are very soft. We dont know about survival in the United States - try living in Albania, Afganistan, Rwanda, or Cuba. \n\nHope that this helps.

Towels are the most useful thing it is possible to have handy in a crisis. One of the first things that Ford Prefect did for Arthur Dent after the demolition of the Earth was to equip him with a towel.\n\nThey can be used for snaring birds whilst falling from a three-mile high marble statue.\n\nThey can be used to signal temporally unstable spaceships by fossilizing them in planetary strata.\n\nThey can be soaked in nutrients to provide sustenance in awkward situations (Although, as Zaphod Beeblebrox found, this is not a terribly tasty solution to hunger).\n\nThey can also do a really good job of drying between your toes.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide is full of suggestions for successful towel deployment. It is worth noting that a cup of white vinegar in a wash will help keep your towels fluffy and soft.\n\nIn other words, they are the NEW Swiss Army Knife!!!
The culture of the people living on the island of Ireland is far from monolithic. Many notable cultural divides exist between the rural people and city dwellers, between the Catholic and Protestant people of Ulster, between the Irish-speaking people within and without the Gaeltacht regions and the English-speaking majority population, between the settled people and the Travellers, and, increasingly, between new immigrants and the native population.
The resolution of an imaging system is limited by diffraction. The image of a point source, such as a star, has an angular size that is proportional to the wavelength of the light or radio waves, divided by aperture. Light waves are around 500 nanometers (500 x 10^-9 meters), while radio astronomy is typically done at wavelengths of a few centimeters (n x 10^-2 meters). So a radio telescope would have to be around 100,000 times the size of an optical telescope to achieve the same resolution. \n\nRather than build impossibly huge radio dishes, radio astronomy uses synthetic aperture techniques, combining the signals from widely separated dishes to get the resolution of a single dish the diameter of the separation.

As with most primates, yes. I'm not too familiar with their "social" structure... but I can try and give a few examples, but I suggest you check them out first because I'm doing this all from memory.\nColobus monkeys are primarily fruit and leaf-eaters. Because they live in environments with lots of trees, and because they are small, there is very limited competition between the monkeys. Therefore, they can live in very large groups. They share land with chimps (Pan troglodytes I think... I don't know about Pan paniscus), who hunt them. Their large group sizes aids in protecting them because they have more of a chance of being able to see the chimps and warn the others before they are attacked.

I am in the most amazing relationship of my life right now!! I had been in a bad relationship for the past 20 years. When I finally left for good and divorced him, I met the most amazing man ever. We are now living together and engaged.\n\nHe really knows how to treat a woman like a woman, rather than a piece of meat or crap. He treats me with kindness, love, and respect, cherishes me, treas me like a God and has me on a pedestal, like I do him. We have soooooooo many things in common it still amazes me. We have just enough not in common to keep things interesting. He works long hours on a farm; I am currently unemployed but looking for a job. He has no problem supporting me during this time. We have great communication and the sex is totally awesome, amazing, fantastic, and all that--just like the whole relationship. I have never had anyone like this in my life, or treat me so great. I am sooooooooooo happy now and plan to stay that way.

i'm not sure about the capitalization, but the selection refers to populational growth. in r-selected populations (such as turtles), many of the offspring die, so females give birth to a huge amount of offspring at once, and generation time is very short. in k-selected populations (such as humans or cows), generation time is very long, and very few offspring are produced and lots of time and energy are invested into taking care of them.

Numerology is the study of the purported mystical or esoteric relationship between numbers and the character or action of physical objects and living things.\n\nNumerology and numerological divination were popular among early mathematicians such as Pythagoras, but are no longer considered to be part of mathematics and are now regarded as pseudomathematics by most mathematicians. This is similar to the historical development of astronomy from astrology, and that of chemistry from alchemy.

They can only if you're under 18 and your parents want you to go. If you are under 18 it's worth a try to tell your doctor that you don't want them to tell your parents. Sometimes they will comply. But in all sincerity, as a recovering anorexic, I would say that being thin in not worth the heath consequenses. My friend who is a recovering bulimirexic almost died of pnemonia becuse her body could no fight off the infection.
You should probably talk to a doctor for real advice but i'll tell you what i think know. A friend of mine has a similar problem, and she was also told that she may find it hard to concieve, her periods can be very erratic and heavy and painful. Its certainly possible you had a miscarriage but i want reassure you not to worry. I believe about a third of women have a miscarriage at some point, most very early in pregnancy and most women will not even be aware they had had one or were pregnant in the first place. So without being the doctor that examined you, i can't be sure if it was a miscarriage or a heavy period, i'd suspect the later as that is more common than you might think but if you have any doubts i'd recommend you speak to your doctor. x

It's really impossible to recommend a bowling ball without seeing you bowl (for instance, what's your typical ball speed?). The best answer is to visit your local pro shop, tell them that you throw a back up ball, and that you're not interested in being trained out of it, but you'd like a new ball. Depending on where you bowl, and how the lanes are oiled, there might be something that the pro shop guy can recommend over the others.\n\nAs for a simple recommendation, any entry level resin ball (The Tornado series from Ebonite; Storm, Brunswick, Columbia each make their own) will give you a simple hook--not a monster hook.

In Florida, you really do not need an attorney.\n\nMost of the contracts are form contracts that are filled out by realtors then the closing is handled by the title company. Use the FARBAR contract... it's very straight forward. Additionally, just keep your eyes open for any addendums or additions.\n\nWith title companies handling the closings, there really isn't as much of a need for real estate attorneys.\n\nReal estate attorneys would be able to handle more sophisticated real estate issues and negotiations. For the most part, sales are very basic. I believe that the real estate market is better off in general without requiring attorneys for a real estate transaction.\n\nI did my fair share of sales in NYC(in which attorneys are required to create contracts and close sales), and for the most part on complicated transactions real estate attorneys are good to have. When the attorney involved was just an 'attorney' they usually created awful messes. Some of which cost my clients hundreds of thousands of dollars because of their incompetence with real estate law.\n\nTransactions here in FL overall are smoother without need for attorneys. And since you are permitted by law to have direct contact with the title company and other participants in the transaction 99% of the attorney's job you can do yourself. Basically, making sure that everyone else is doing their thing.\n\nThe last 1% that a real estate attorney might be helpful with is for document reveiw. If you are unable to 'cough' read or unable to sign the documents yourself... then they can be useful for FL transactions.\n\nAgain, I say this because the paperwork is standardized in a very high percentage of the transactions. If you saw something that was really out of place... then I'd seek their advice.

All of the USB devices that you have connected to the USB hub are drawing too much power -- more power than what your USB hub can provide. \n\nYou have 2 choices: 1) remove some USB devices to free up power. 2) make sure that your USB hub has its own power cable conencted to a power outlet -- this will most likely fix your power problem.\n\nIf your USB hub does not offer the option to plug it into a power outlet, you may want to consider purchasing one that does.

Yes. The news tends to make people insensitive by the way it presents the most sensational view of what is happening with the world. For instance say there is some disaster it is presented and then we hear no more about it unless it is deemed newsworthy - the people living with that disaster can't just switch off, they're stuck with it. Because we can switch off at any time we cease to be shocked by the shocking. It gives us the pretence of being in control when we are really not.

Sure... To do this, you need to examine the yield strength of all joints of the cart and what they are rated for. (For example, Find out what kind of load is placed on the axle and then choose an axel that can withstand that weight...) The maximum weight that you can hold on the cart is the maximum weight that the WEAKEST link of your cart can withstand.\n\n(Conservatively, one also introduces some factor of safety here. Multiply the maximum yield of the weakest link by a factor of 80-90% to give you some wiggle room in case you dynamically load -- i.e. drop weight on the cart.)
The question is very vague -- we're not given any information about what Bob's marital status (or rather whether he is withholding at a married or single rate) \n\nat 900 a week, he takes home $46800 annually. 6.2% of his 65k salary goes to Social Security ($4030) and 1.45% goes to Medicare (942.50). $60027.50 left before figuring his tax percentage, which works out at 22% (but that's not a correct figure, as it doesn't figure in state taxes, personal exemption, and standard deduction)

The main character of Pride and Prejudice is Elizabeth Bennet, who is a very intelligent, sweet and strong girl who comes from a family of 5 daughters. She is the second eldest sister. Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Catherine (Kitty) and\nLidya are the sisters (in order of age). She is also a little bit proud and her pride and Mr. Darcy's prejudice are the matters that bring this story all together. What attracts Mr.Darcy who has an incredible income of 10.000 pounds a year comes to their village with his good friend Mr. Bingley who also has a very considerable income. However, in the first meeting they have (which is a ball that the Bennets throw) Mr. Bingley is immediately attracted to Jane the eldest Bennet sister but Mr. Darcy is quite tired of beautiful girls who throw themselves at him and he even calls Elizabeth "barely tolerable". However, the story goes on and Mr. Darcy falls deeply in love with Lizzie (Elizabeth) and... \nYou find out the rest.

My experience says yes. My former wife is a nurse and they gave free flu shots for family members at her hospital. The one and only time our family went in for the shot was the one and only time all of us caught the flu. I never got the shot again, and never caught the flu again. But maybe it was just a coincidence.
It is really hard to get a personal loan for that much without having previous credit history or collateral. If you are paying that much for a home that connot be financed anymore, then you are probably paying too much for it anyway. Look into it a little deeper before you buy it, but from what I understand, I would stay far away from it.

Bull fighting is a huge part of Spanish society and culture. Rightly or wrongly. The astonishing thing about it is that the rest of the world consider it to be a sport. This amazes the Spanish people. Bull fighting has never been considered a sport in Spain. It is a form of theatre. It is a display of man against beast and is one of the largest audience spectacles in the world. It is classed as "tragic theatre" in much the same way as "Macbeth" by Shakespeare. \n\nThe bulls that are used in the bullfights are specifically bred for that purpose and until their "day of reckoning" they are kept in the lap of luxury and are fed the best of food.....the training grounds are immaculate and the spend their days being pampered and very well looked after. Of course they have their final day in the bullring and we all know the results of that. It is however part of the theatre and part of the culture of Spain.\n\nBy the way, I am not a supporter of bull-fighting but I do know a lot about the history of it.....it is not as simple as killing for killing's sake. The bull will always die, that is the tragedy of the theatre of the bullfight, but the unknown element and the excitement comes from the knowledge that the matador could also die in his efforts to kill the bull...that is what the crowd go for.....the challenge of man against beast...it is part of the old spanish culture.

Most states have a redemption period, but there is a catch: You have to redeem the loan and any fees and accrued interest for cash. In other words, you have to either find the cash from somewhere (unlikely) or get someone to loan it to you (equally unlikely).\n\nIn this case, you say you want to sell the property. It is too late for that. You needed to do that *before* the trustee's sale. No lender in the world is going to agree to that request. They've already gone and spent the money for default, lost all the interest and payments and everything, sat on this non-performing loan for months and months, and after they finally decide you're not going to save it and they bite the bullet and foreclose, and suddenly, now that it's no longer yours, you want to sell? Ask a lawyer in your state, but I don't think you're going to have much luck with that one.\n\nFurthermore, it's not like people didn't try to tell you. Anywhere in the country, as soon as that Notice of Default hit, you had real estate agents and lawyers and hard money lenders by the dozen trying to talk to you. Yeah, they were trying to sell you something. That doesn't alter the fact that the most important thing they told you was that you needed to take some kind of action right then, and whatever else they told you, that much was the truth.\n\nI know this is going to be hard to accept. That doesn't change the facts. You agreed to pay the loan back. You didn't. Furthermore, you did nothing with that grace period (absolute minimum of about seven months here in California) that the law gives you in which to act. Forget that property. It is gone. Move forward and get on with your life.
Listen, only you can know if it is right or not. I would talk to him and ask if he like you, trust me, in the long run you don't want to get hurt. Only you can make a good decision in the long run, but you need all the info. Its the safest way to know.

A couple years ago, I had a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year because he had developed a serious drug habit and I had a not quite one year old daughter to take care of, and was starting to get my own life together. One day I heard his name on the radio- he had been shot seven times in the back of his head and his body was found in a dumpster outside a recycling plant. I later found out from my daughter's father, who still saw my friend on a pretty regular basis, that two weeks before he was murdered, my friend had become a Christian. The reason he had been killed was because he was trying to get out of his old lifestyle and away from his old friends and start a new life following Christ. His former friends apparently thought he was really just trying to make an excuse to go and tell the police about them and their drug use, so they killed him. From the story I heard of what happened that night, the people who shot him had asked him to go somewhere with him, and he was scared to go because he knew they were up to something. But, despite the fact that he was afraid, I think he was ready to give up his life because he had accepted Jesus as his savior before he died. Chances are, although I can't say for sure, you will not be killed for your faith, but even if you are, you are already ready because of your faith.
I tried it and I did feel great. It completely got rid of my appetite. The only thing is that I put in more maple syrup than was in the recipe and that is the reason that after twelve days I only lost 2 pounds. But I did not do it to lose weight. I did it for the cleansing value. It was remarkable that I never felt edgy or out of sorts. Whenever I was feeling a little hungry I drank another glass. It really felt good and since it was the first time that I have ever fasted in all of my 50 years I think that I was a great experience which I will continue to do on a quarterly basis. If I ever want to skip a meal it is very effective and does not cause any negative side effects that I experienced. Try it you'll like it. I did.

Humans are a very small cost of global warming. Anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere only account for 4% of all greenhouse gases. If you look at graphs scientists make up of the temperature over the past 100,000,000 years you can see that we are just at another warm period in our earths history. There has been warmer times before. I don't really know how the scientists can figure out what the temperature was 100,000,000 years ago but i have a graph in my environmental science text book that shows that they have.

We have to change our understandings of the world around us and our knowledge base throughout our lives as the world and society change and our understanding of them change. When we start a new job or leave high school for university or get married we have to leave behind some of our old ways and learn new ones. \n\nActually, "unlearning" can be harder than "learning". It is rather like breaking a habit - can be very difficult to do. It is why once a baby learns that mom or dad will come into his room if he cries when he is put to bed, it takes quite a bit of persistence to break that cycle.\n\nYou have to focus on the "unlearning", depending on what the topic is (this would bve easier to answer if we knew what you have to "unlearn"). And persistently practice whatever the new behavior or idea or concept needs to be.\n\nThese links may help.

I looked into it for my youngest dd. We attended an hour long presentation that they held about the program. Our state has the virtual homeschool option where you can attend for free if the child begins in kindergarten or has been attending public school, so I looked into it for my dd. There were several drawbacks for our situation which may not be a big deal for others.\n\nFirst of all, the positives about the program include that I think the curriculum is very good. I was impressed with the K12 curriculum. It seemed very good when looking at it. Math, History, Art, everything were standouts, and that was the main reason I was interested in the program. They also provide you with a computer with the program which probably most of us do not need, but is a nice addition to the program.\n\nThe drawbacks for me were: probably the biggest is that they only had so many slots funded by the state, and our state is a large state. (Probably each state varies with how many slots they fund for the program so I would probably just ask.) Additionally, we were not applying early in the process, did not find out about the program early in the year but towards the end of the application process, and if I was going to bother with the program I would only apply towards the beginning of the application process, not at the end as it probably fills up and if you are submitting your application in the last month or two may not get into the program at all I would think. You also have to do all the paperwork with your pediatrician, etc. and just not worth it if the slots are already full.\n\nThere is quite a bit of teacher interaction which can be a positive for some, probably esp. for those just beginning homeschooling, but for me with several years of experience I thought some of it might be irritating. Your "supervising" teacher emails you each day I guess with questions, assignments, or comments or whatever and you are required to check in daily and email back. You also are required to mail in samples of the child's work and exams. You are also required to do the state's standardized testing that they do in the public schools each year (my daughter is special needs-autism spectrum) so I was a little worried about that requirement.\n\nEach month there is a field trip you are required to attend, which would have been a problem for me as I am homeschooling another child. If you have more than one child, even if they are attending the K12 program that could be a problem as the program leader said they break the field trip groups into ages, for example, K-2, 3-5th, etc. so you would have to be in more place than one, since she said the parent is supposed to attend, and my dh usually cannot leave work. So I would have to find someone to babysit my other child who does not attend K12, while I attended the K12 field trip. They sounded pretty inflexible on that one, but what if you have 3 or 4 kids in the program??? I thought that was a very strange requirement for homeschoolers who often do have a lot of children of different ages.\n\nAnyway, I do love the K12 curriculum and think they do have some of the best curriculum out there, just wish they would relax some of their restrictions and prices a bit!
Yeah,she is dead.\nJean assumed the position of acting headmistress of the Xavier Institute and was revisited by the Phoenix Force. Following an attack on the X-Men by a mutant impersonating Magneto named Xorn (who had previously been a teacher at the institute), Jean and Wolverine were trapped on a space station that was hurtling into the sun. Seeing no hope for survival, and wanting to spare his teammate further suffering, Wolverine seemingly killed Jean, unleashing the Phoenix Consciousness within her and resurrecting her. Returning to Earth, Jean, with the power of the Phoenix, opposed the faux Magneto and was killed by a massive stroke induced by a lethal electromagnetic pulse.

The person who holds the highest veritcal jump is a white guy. Look at all the high jumpers in track and field, mostly white guys. Ethinicity has nothing to do with the ability to jump high. It does seem balck guys jump higher in b-ball, but that is b/c there are more black guys who play basketball. Can you say white guys are better skaters and swimmers? No! Less blacks in those sports.\n\nI have played and coached for over 20 years and you know what makes you jump high is your inate ability, athleticism and drive, not skin colour.

Because the USA is greedy and uses more fuel, especially gasoline, that it extracts at present. The cost of extracting US oil is much higher than oil obtained from the Middle East as most countries there literally float on the stuff. Therefore, most US oil companies get their oil from the Middle East as US consumer always tend to kick up hell whenever the price goes up so the oil companies buy the cheapest crude oil they can find, which is in the Middle East.

Mine too. Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They're also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids. \n\nTriglycerides in plasma are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other energy sources like carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue so they meet the body's needs for energy between meals.\n\nHow is an excess of triglycerides harmful?\n\nExcess triglycerides in plasma is called hypertriglyceridemia. It's linked to the occurrence of coronary artery disease in some people. Elevated triglycerides may be a consequence of other disease, such as untreated diabetes mellitus. Like cholesterol, increases in triglyceride levels can be detected by plasma measurements. These measurements should be made after an overnight food and alcohol fast.

Best thing to do is comfront your guy with this question, remember communication is essential in a relationship right along with love and trust. You'll never know till you ask him about the other girl. Watch out for warning signs too! Have a great day and keep on searching til you find the truth. GOOD LUCK
nope he's not.
TELL HIM.... I was in the same boat with a girl I knew many years ago.... I fell in love with her as a friend..... then, as we got closer and closer... I fell in love with her completely... and I knew she cared about me but, neither of us every told each other how we truly felt.... though we stayed friends.. I ended up moving away and we didn't keep in touch often enough.. next thing I knew.. she met a guy and they got married... I told her several years later after she'd had two children... she told me she was in love with me but didn't think I liked her that way.\nShe would have married me... I would have married her... but we didn't tell each other how we felt until it was too late. We're still friends.. but we don't see each other now because I think we both know what would happen.\n\nDon't wait until it's completely too late... tell him now.... if your friendship is powerful.... it'll remain that way regardless... if he feels the same way... maybe his 'current' relationship will end and he'll be with you.... but if you don't tell him, you'll regret it for the rest of your life and will always want to know.....\n\nI hope it works out for you!
Interior design is the process of shaping the experience of interior space, through the manipulation of spatial volume as well as surface treatment. Interior Design draws on aspects of environmental psychology, architecture, product design and furniture design in addition to traditional decoration. An interior designer is a person who is considered an expert in the field of interior design or one who designs interiors as part of their job. In many jurisdictions, interior designers must be licensed to practice.
Hey you rightwing freak, why is it that you "love" this country so much but have never read the bill of rights? Freedom of speech. Love it or leave it.\n\nor as Utah Phillips said, "Love for my county, ALWAYS, love for the government ONLY WHEN THEY DESERVE IT!"

Actually, N has to do with the amount of electrons that the element has. the first level has a maximum of two electroins, so all elements that have under 2 electrons will be in this level (hydrogen has 1 e, He has 2). The 2nd energy level can hold up to 8 electrons, so look at the atomic number (# of electrons and determine which energy level it would be under). N=3, maximum number of electrons is from 9-18)

Pain in the butt. \nI use TuneUp Utilities. http://www.tune-up.com/products/tuneup-utilities/ \n It was the only way I found to get rid of it. It will completely remove it from your system, (it also does all this nice fine tuning, speeds things up, registry cleaners etc.)\nGreat program that you can download and try for free. Then, if you like it pay for it, if you don't, remove it.

My national league favorite is the Cubs. Probably because they have such a similar history to my real favorite, the Red Sox. I'm a fanatic and either watch the games on TV with the MLB package because I live in Florida, or XM radio, and even sink to watching the play by play on "Gameday". I don't think I've missed a pitch in 3 years. Oh, yeah, I go to St. Petersburg whenever they come to play the Devil Rays.\n\nBut, I'd love to see the Cubs win the world series. With the way things are going the past few years it's only right. Better yet, play the Red Sox in the world series. They can win that one if they promise to go 7 games, but if they end up playing the Yankees I want the Cubs to sweep with a 4 game shutout.

if it is not in the contract and you have not signed the paper to agree to it, they can't make you work the extra hours and they can't fire you if you don't.\n\nThe fact that took six weeks to get back to you and then came back empty handed only to have to redraft a new means that they have not been properly informing for of their expectations and your rights.\n\nIf they say that the 'on call' nature of your job in reflected in your wages you have te right to ask for a break down of pay. i.e basic wages and on call allowance. if they don't provide you with this seek advice.\n\nIf you signed the contract (the original) you should have been given a copy which they also sighed.\n\nIf you are not happy with the way they are treating you go to the citizen advice bureau as they have employment specialists on hand to inform you of your rights and they can even speak to your boss on your behalf.

They have pretty-much fully cooperated with US efforts. There have been moments that the US's sometimes clumsy actions have tested this alliance, though, such as when those civilians were accidentally bombed by that remote-controlled bomber airplane. I really wish the US would take better care of the nations that cooperate with it. These days friendships have been hard to come by. I used to be critical of Pakistan but they've been very friendly to our cause lately.

It always seems the moment a girl gets a boyfriend they get a whole lot more attention from the other guys in their life. I'd think it's just playful flirting and maybe trying to assert themselves a little as men...or perhaps to keep you and your bf from not hanging out with them (like to show they're comfortable with you- maybe now that you're off limits)

Silly me... I've tried that and failed... I guess my lightbulb just went off and I've come to this conclusion:\n\nRelationship is a trail to see if you're ment to be together forever. You should be looking for someone who makes you happy <you need to define happiness 4 yourself> above all else...if it doesn't work out, then you can only look at the way you behaved, and try to make yourself better; DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP IN THIS PROCESS!!! You should be look for happiness alone if this is where you take yourself.\n\nMy friend just broke up with her feionce <SP??? Future husband>, and he won't take her dog... Now, she's moved into a tiny apartment <from a house> and she's got this massive dog. She loves this dog, and it gives her happy feelings about the past relationship...however, she is consumed by guilt for keeping the doggie in a small space. Concequently, she's always yelling at the doggie because of the guilt. I realized my cheeting ex was treating me this way...he brought a new girl into his heart, now there wasn't enough room, and I got yelled at because he felt guilty...\n\nI finally got the light and "Drop kicked him to the curve". Yeah, I'm free, and finally away from negitivity, so I'm getting happy again...I still long for the good old days, but recognize, they're in the past.

They are called floaters. I have them also. Floaters are the small spots you may occasionally see in your field of vision. The medical name for floaters is muscae volitantes. Floaters can be seen in many different forms, including dots, threads, or cobwebs. Floaters may seem to dart away when you try to look at them.Most spots and eye floaters are merely annoying but harmless when they temporarily enter the field of vision, and many fade over time. People sometimes are interested in surgery to remove floaters, but doctors are willing to perform such surgery only in rare instances.\n\nIf you suddenly see new floaters, or eye floaters accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, it could indicate serious conditions such as diabetic retinopathy; vascular abnormalities such as retinal hemorrhages or carotid artery disease, or the beginning of a retinal detachment. The retina can tear if the shrinking vitreous gel pulls away from the wall of the eye. This sometimes causes a small amount of bleeding in the eye that may appear as new floaters. You should see your eye doctor immediately.

I have often fined my self asking this question. will I fined true love will I fined the one with whom I’m meant to be? though I am alone now the answer is simple and clear love is out there its all around us in the air we breath the water we drink its an invisible force the binds the world and no mater who you are or what you do there is some one out there just waiting to fined you waiting to hold you in there arms to look in your eyes and say I love you. Yes you will fined your love I am as cretin of this as I am that some day it will come to me there is some one for every one though we may be lonely now we just need to wait hold in a little longer for you never know what waits for you behind that corner up ahead
ok...well here is a detailed explaination\n\nfirst you need to conver 8 1/4 to an improper fraction,\nin general this means:\na b/c = (a*c +b)/c\n\nin your case \n8 1/4 = (8*4 +1)/4 = (32+1)/4 = 33/4\n\nthen you need to do the same for the second fraction\n5 1/2 = (5*2 +1)/2 = (10+1)/2 = 11/2\n\nnow you have the following\n33/4 -11/2\n\nwell to add this you need to have common denominators (bottoms of the fractions), to do this you need to find the smallest number that both 4 and 2 go into...in this case both of these numbers go into 4...(4*1=4 and 2*2=4)\n\nnow you need to get that second fraction to have a denominator of 4...to do this you notice that 2*2 is 4 so we need to multiply that second fraction by 2/2 (so the top and bottom of the fraction is multiplied by 2. you would wonder why the top and bottom...the reason is because 2/2 =1 and we can multiply a number by 1 and it doesnt chage its value...we are just making 1 look funny so we can get the same denomintors\n\nnow ...\n\n11/2 * 2/2 = (11*2)/ (2*2) = 22/4 ( we recall we multiply the two top numbers and the two bottom numbers respectively)\n\nnow do your subtraction now that we have common denomintaors\n\n33/4-22/4 = (33-22)/4 (here we only subtract the numerator (top))\n\nso 11/4 is our answer\n\ni hope this helps....\nmatttlocke

I have done years of research about this subject,and unfortunatly i cant explain all the facts through yahoo answers,if you are interested you can contact me,so i can give you the detailed explainatin of upcoming events.but the good news is....at the end...it will be alot better than we can imagine///////

of course your bowels need to be cleaned. but first of all why do you feel the need? if you are having a lot of digestive issues, then you should do a cleanse. you can get one in your local natural health store. most will be about 12-15 days long. you will take herbal supplements and eat a diet that cuts out sugar, dairy , wheat and most acidic foods. lots of brown rice, veggies and salmon. you will spend the first few days on the toilet but by the end of the cleanse feel great. then when you start to introduce the stuff you werent eating back into your diet, you will be able to feel your reactions to these foods and decide if you are having problems with them. if it is a serios problem with your bowel, i would consider contacting a colon hydro therapist ( look in the yellow pages) and getting hydro therapy that way. you will fast for a few days and then have your bowel pumped full of water to be cleansed. sounds gross but is really great results.

Please ask the question again, I can't understand.\n\nTo change 1 cc of water 1 deg.C requires 1 (small) calorie = 4.2 Joules
the formulas it seems your looking for are:\n\np=mv=J=Ft where p, v, and t actually have a the symbol delta in front of them meaning "change in"\n\np is momentum which equals mass times the change in velocity and J is impulse which equals force x time. Because the change in momentum is equal to the impulse, you can usually set mv=Ft. You should be given the mass and velocity, and either force or the change in time(duration) in order to solve for the other one. If the question is asking for both, then you probably have to find force first in some other way, then use that formula. If you need to find the force in some other way, just think about all of Newton's laws and stuff that you've learned and use them with the rest of the information that the problem gives you, and you should be able to come up with something... if not, post the whole question here and ill try to help :)

I would write to the bank asking for a full breakdown of their charges and for them to explain how they can justify charges on charges.

For that to be true he would have to have absolute power. And anyone who thinks he did have absolute power, needs to brush up on their American government.\n\nActually, that is incorrect. A) Republicans do not control the Supreme Court, though they do like to take more than their fair share of power, not matter whose appointees are on the bench. B) Rep. can hardly be called a cohesive unit - just as the democrats cannot. These are individual people, though they share many beliefs, they are not all 100% for touting the party line (which would have to be true for them to have absolute power). An example of this woul be the recent immigration debate, where several Republicans did not join their party majority, but sided with the Dems. I must assume that when you said that is as close as they can come to absolute power, you meant is our form of government. Otherwise, you would be dead wrong.
The Republicans have quite a lot of scandal with prostitution right now. I believe there is going to be indictments.

The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India.
Not much more damage than it had done one hundred, two hundred or perhaps one thousand years ago.\n\nOur world has several natural disasters that have been occuring over time. Nowadays, however, with the growing populace, the media coverage and the ability to share that media with everyone quickly, something as simple as a hurricane, tornado or even the eruption of a volcano becomes an overnight sensation.\n\nHurricanes actually do help, in civilized cultures, to improve detection and warning systems, as well as allow for new things to be rebuilt (and perhaps much better) after it does its damage.

When I was in 7th grade there was a bully who sat in the desk next to mine in history class. Every time the teacher's back was turned he'd lean over and punch me hard on the arm. By the end of each day my arm was covered in bruises.\n\nOne day I got some cloth ribbon and some heavy tape, and fashioned an armband out of it with sharp thumbtacks sticking out. I concealed this under my sleeve the next day before class.\n\nAfter that day he never hit me again. That was my favorite day in junior high school.
Im a sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.

You need to rest it. If you don't it's just going to get worse and then you will be out for a really long time. Take a couple of days off and rest it. Use the RICE protocol (rest, ice, compression and elevation).
My religious belief is that a child is innocent until they are capable of knowledge between right and wrong and are capable of accepting Jesus as their Lord and Savior. If your child was still a baby, then trust that he/she would be in heaven.

Is there a question in here couse i dont see one
Shouldn't you be asking HIM this question?
aware is something like being careful and being aware of what's around you.Aware means: Realizing things,knowing about things around you and, being conscious.
s = sales\nc = commision\n\nc = s * (20/100) = .20s\n\nSo if you mean that he gets a base salary of $1,500 PLUS whatever he earns in commision, then\n\nPay = 1500 + .20s\n\nIf you mean that he gets paid 20% commision, and if the commision isn't at least 1500, then he gets 1500, then\n\nPay = 1500 OR .20s , whichever is higher.\n\n\nIn this case, his commision (c) is\nc = .20 * 6550\nc = 1310\n\nSo his pay is either $1,500 (since 1310 is less than 1500) or $2,810 (1310+1500) depending one which your looking for. The phrasing of your question leaves doubt as to which you're looking for.

I work at a child psychologist office and I grade intelligence tests all the time. If you want to determine your IQ, go see a psychologist because online IQ tests can be inaccurate.\n\n100 is average and most people are around 100 IQ.\n\n140 and over - Genius or near genius - 2.2% (of the population)\n120-140 - Very superior intelligence - 6.7%\n110-120 - Superior intelligence - 16.1%\n90-110 - Normal or average intelligence - 50 %\n80-90 - Dullness - 16.1%\n70-80 - Borderline deficiency - 6.7%\nBelow 70 - Definite feeble-mindedness 2.2%\n\nFYI, I'm about 124.\n\nIf you have a very high IQ, you may be eligible for a membership with MENSA.\n\nBut I wouldn't worry over IQ scores. They really just helpful to determine needs (gifted, special education, etc).
CSI's would never talk to suspects/witnesses or go into houses where they think the suspect is hiding & armed. \n\nI know more about the lab-rat types who don't go into the field at all. The cops just give them all the evidence they found and think could be useful and the analyst picks out a few things tha have the best chance of having the suspects DNA or other important evidence. There isn't time to analyze every single item left at a crime scene. You have to pick out the important things.\n\nTests take way longer to get back than on the show. The show would be ridiculously boring if they had to wait days or weeks for tests to be done.\n\nIn real life they don't really find that much evidence. This is actually becomming an issue in courts. They call it the CSI effect and it is very damaging. Jurors want to see concrete DNA evidence on everything or they think there must be some doubt. As if people have a floating cloud of DNA around them that leaves evidence on everything they touch. It just doesn't work that way.

I'd say you'd probably get beaten for what I'm about to suggest, but here it goes. You could always go and get counseling like the other girl said and talk to your parents, make sure they understand whats going on. You could try dressing as a girl if that is what you desire, and you could have a relationship with another boy/man. You could also look into a sex change, and no I'm not joking.

I like your question and your answer. You NAILED it. Bush got caught with his foot in his mouth. His attempt to spread democracy in the middle east his way backfired on him. Yep, instead of congratulating hamas on their elected victory, something he's not too familiar with, he wants them to renounce terrorism and put down their weapons, or take away their foreign aid money. Now that I think about it, would Bush even be in office if we had fair elections?

The first answer is really good, but you might also want to figure out what it is that frightens you. It's probably something you're making up (like, "It's brain cancer and I'm going to die!!!!") and if you recognize that's what's scaring you, you can remind yourself that that's really not what's going on, and is no reason to be scared.
the question is too simple... there are pros and cons. i think it is great to afford women in this country as many of the same opportunities to serve as we can. but i do think there are some differences that we as a society must be ready to accept if they are going to be on the front lines. it was hard for americans to see the desecrated bodies of american soldiers in mogadishu-dragged by the locals-how hard will that image be when its a woman? i will agree that women can be as aggressive and intelligent as men when called on to fight. i have seen a lot of impressive things from women troopers-ladies who can keep up with me on a march, and i'm not slow. who can shoot as well as me- and i shhot excellently. but combat involves a lot of "hurryup and wait" and boredom sets in...if i was in a foxhole with a female for days waiting for an attack that might never come, what happens when things get sexually heavy? will we be punished? yep. is it a natural instinct to find comfort with the opposite sex? yep. does it screwup the good order and discipline? yep. read robert heilein's starship troopers- or watch the crappy movie- you'll see that american society presently has a lot of gender hangups that make this a flawed effort. we have some successes, but we have a long way to go. presently they require seperate showers, berthing, and toilet facilities...which means some navy ships have to be expensively refurbished and welded to provide those spaces... also, it can be a distraction- it just is... as a soldier you train hard to mostly shut off that sexual need, and concentrate on the misery of your life while deployed- the scent of a woman is terribly distracting at those times and requires an even higher effort of selfdiscipline. if you think the rules for sexual harassment are tough on cvillians-you have no idea what it is here. also, consider the following tactical scenario... a flight crew gets shot down behind enemy lines and there are only 2 survivors- a male intelligence officer who has tactically important knowledge, and a female grunt who is a lower level iportance to the overall mission. they hae been trapped in a POW camp for 8 months, and after being raped by her captor she is now pregnant. however, the rescue gets botched and there is only enough room to evacuate one of the prisoners-the intel officer is of tactical advantage, but he (in my opinion) must be left to save the innocent infant-further damaging the mission. i know its a stretch of the iagination, but i think it- and the public's horror and dismay at the jessica lynch episode, demonstrates that in our society's eyes a women captive is of more value than a man, and that gives me pause. and don't tell me about women aren't on the front lines- that's dated WW2 war theory- the front lines in a guerrilla war/ terrorism fight are constantly moving so that nowhere is safe...

This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick). It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is. During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues, which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing. Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.

I will take all of them in any form I can get them in.\nWe need,no we must.stop this endless flow of illegal aliens into this nation. We are drowning in a sea of illegals that have no love for this nation,no love and even less respect.They marched in our streets,they desecrated of nations flag,they call us names and shout that they will take over this country.How do you expect Americans to react to that? Do you expect us to reach out to the illegal alien and embrace him? If you treat people and this nation like ca ca then expect retaliation in kind.I love this country and every time I hear anyone say any thing bad or disrespectful about her,it makes me angry.The illegal will talk about that in the future they will be the majority,but nothing is written in stone,something could happen that would render the illegal from reproducing,you could suddenly have a zero birth rate.What happens to your plans for take over then?\nI'm only asking that people think,nothing is for sure but death,and they are postponing it longer and longer.Why not live for today,live for right now .Why not open your heart and your mind to this nation and its people.Why do you hate us so much?America will never be Mexico,never.\nOr any other country that you come from.Its always going to be the United States of America.

Not so complicated. You like your BF, but you are atrracted to this other guy.\n\nSharing humor is SO IMPORTANT I can't even describe to you.\n\nIf you have that, things will tend to go farther.\n\nYour BF seems to be an understanding guy, just figure out what you want and go for it. The way I see it, you and your BF don't really have a chance, the genie's out of the bottle. If you go with him, you will alwasy wonder what it would be like to go for Mr. SmartSexyDangerous. Also, will he ever really trust you again, since he knows that you might be attracted to other men?\n\nDo your best to break it gently but cleanly with you BF. Don't hop into a relationship right away. Give you guys both some time... then let yourself free.
I rarely cry, As a man, I don't feel the need too very often. I am not saying that women shouldn't or that they are weak because they do. I just don't get very emotional. If I do get to the point to where I am crying then I really don't care who is around. I am a grown up and if I think I should cry then hopefully people won't see me as a child or to emotional but if they do then they don't have very many brains and are very ill educated. Crying is a very important part of life and I think it is a healthy thing to do some times.

It depends on where you are from. In Massachusettes it is $30 and if you are underage you need a parent to consent. If one of your parents are not in the picture you have to put an ad in a newspaper for one week to see if it will be disputed by your other parent. If you are over the age of 18 you can call your local town hall or the town hall of the city you were born in and they can give you more information.
Is 3 the standard deviation or the variance? Since X1, X2, and X3 are all nromal and independent, then \n\nX1 + X2 + X3 ~ N(0+0+0 = 0, sqrt(3^2+3^2+3^2) = sqrt(27)), if 3 was the SD.\nN(0, 3+3+3 = 9) if 3 was the variance.\n\nIn general, if X_i ~ N(mu_i, sigma_i), where sigma_i is the SD, then the sum of X_i ~ N(sum mu_i, sqrt(sum (sigma_i)^2)).\n\nSince the mean of your distribution is 0, then P(X1+X2+X3>0) = 0.5. Remember that the mean splits the normal distribution in half.
It depends on your level of action while playing the game. If you play light and hesitate a lot between directions, it is unlikely that you will notice any great change, but if you play light rather fluidly and consistently for 30+ minutes a week, it is possible that you could lose some weight in the process. To further the effects, you could always try eating better, eating smaller portions, eating slower, and adding more physical activity to your regimen.\n\nGood luck! (It does happen!)

Well, right now, there are only four women left: Vaidisova, Kuznetsova, Hardenne, and Clijters. I was going for Hingis, but she got strangled by Clijsters. I personally do not want Vaidisova or Clijsters to win. I think Vaidisova is dooping. Too bad, the officials will find out after the tornament is over. And, i don't want Clijsters to win because she is retiring anyways by the end of the year. So i don't think she should retire as the dominant female player in tennis. I want to see Kuznetsova and Hardenne in the final. By the way, did you know that Kuznetsova and Hardenne met in the 4th round of last year's French Open? Kuznetsova had like 2 match points, but Hardenne managed to overcome them and ended up winning the match, along with the other matches. Kuznetsova was the only player that chellenged her, the rest could not even take a set off her. But yeah, i would be happy if any of them wins, they deserve it. \nOn the men's side, there are two players on one side of the draw: Federer and Nalvandian, and on the other side of the draw, there are still 4 players left: Burnememansm, Ljubicic, Nadal, and Djokovic. Out of all of them, i think that Nadal and Federer are going to make it to the final, where Nadal might finally get his nachos crunched on clay. But, i would rather see Djonkovic win, he is just, just,..so nice to watch, that hair, those eyes,... so yeah, i hope he wins, or at leat make it to the final.

It's usually low self esteem,anger ie :- hurt people hurt people..and sh*t rolls downhill.. Putting people down in one way or another makes the bully/coward feel good about him/herself.. They want to seem to be in control to feel important.. They're usually insecure.. they're afraid to let you see the real them because that's all they've got and it might not be enough for you so they try to show some sort of domination/power trait.. In short it makes them feel better !
Now this is a tough question to answer without using a little physiology lingo. Unlike skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control, the heart is an involuntary muscle. Most of us cannot just tell our heart to slow down or speed up. The beating frequency (heart rate) is controlled by the balance of stimulation coming from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the Autonomic Nervous System. Both nervous imputs to the heart converge on a small area of tissue on the right atrium called the Sino-atrial node. Parasympathetic (rest and recover) stimulation tends to slow down the rate, while sympathetic (fight or flight) input increases the rate (and the force of contraction). Normally, there is a balance between the two inputs leaning toward the parasympathetic side. However, even without any nervous input, the heart will beat automatically due to some unique features of its membrane physiology. This intrinsic rate is quite slow however (about 20 bpm). A purely parasympathetic stimulation will result in a heart rate of about 30. So the average untrained person has a resting heart rate of about 70 as a result of some constant sympathetic stimulation. With training, the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation tends to shift in favour of the parasympathetic, resulting in a slower resting heart rate. Elite endurance athletes may have resting HRs of 35 to 40. \nThe part of the brain behind this and breathing is called the Medulla.\n\nIt is the caudal-most part of the brainstem and contains many sensory (ascending) and motor (descending) tracts. The pyramid is an example of the latter. Structures that are linked with the cerebellum and part of the reticular formation are also in the medulla.\n\nCertain groups of neurons in the reticular formation control respiration, and the cranial nerve important for maintaining an open airway and controlling heart rate is located here.\n\nThus, if the integrity of the medulla is compromised, vital functions are compromised and death often results.

i think there is a wave of xenophobia sweeping through right now and that is causing alot of it. as for facts that back up the quotes...many of them are not compiled correctly, or promoted heavily from skinhead and other racist sources, but passed around until they aren't really connected with those sources anymore. and much like any "facts" from those areas are very very distorted, or even just made up.\n\ni also find it interesting that many of the people that are attacking the illegal immigrants would also probably not hesitate to say they would do anything at all for their families...and many illegals have said this was a driving force behind their decision to cross the border.\n\nas for the groups that say they should do it legally or what not...laws change, thats just the way it is and thank god we live in a country where the laws are flexible, despite how slow and red tape filled this process can be sometimes. so yeah during this time of the law changing some people are going to get it easier than those previous to the change, but there always seems to be people resistant to this.\nlook at the equal rights movements, the start of unions, women's rights to vote, etc etc...there was an alarming number of people that heavily tried to resist these movements as well....and sadly some still do.\n\nas for hurting this country, i don't really see it, illegal immigrants are not going to make or break any of the programs that are starting to buckle right now, but do make a convenient scapegoat i think as something people can point to and blame. on the other hand, they do spend a good bit, and many local businesses depend on the money they spend(which they are charged sales tax on) so these companies would really get hit hard if they lost those customers. apartment landlords would also really take a hit it seems, and despite the fact we have homeless people, there isn't really a shortage of housing available.
First, don't listen to these smart-ass people bein' rude to you. Second, i would recommend that you go to a health clinic and tell them that you haven't had your period in a few months and they will give u a pill that will make u ovualate. I believe u take it for 10 days so wait about the 6 day to have sex, and if that doesn't work then have yourself checked out to see if you can get pregnant. hope all goes well.....
All I have to say about that is the way to get a man to NOT love you is to look for a "weakness" to exploit. Just be yourself.

There are 9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 possible ways to arrange 9 players in a batting order. That comes out to 362,880.\n\nWhen is this homework assignment due?\n\n\nEDIT: ong jon (See below) is correct. I was referring, of course, to the number of possible ways you can arrange nine positions into a batting order, not how many ways a roster of 25 or 26 players can be so arranged...
Huh. Interesting query. I would say that if you don't think there's anything wrong with being human, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. \nYou'll probably get tired eventually.\nHowever, even being "safe" is not always 100%. Make sure you get tested regularly, and try your best to not have a different guy every night so you can backtrack just in case.\nAlso, remember that no one ever got an STD from masturbating, and there are quite a few products out there to keep it interesting.\nHave fun, and have a pleasant day.

God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. \nbut...\nThe Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical."Sophie looked skeptical. "My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth.""My point exactly," Langdon said. "Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people."\n"The Da Vinci Code"
If you mean the air blowing through the nozzle, then yes you can. The air has to be under pressure and as it flows through the nozzle the pressure drops suddenly which causes a cooling effect. This is known as the Joules-Thompson effect or J-T for short. It is used in industrial processes to cool gas streams. The drawback is that unless you have a large pressure drop ( probably at least 30 or 40 psi) the cooling will not be significant. The power required to raise the air to that pressure is quite a bit and the noise the nozzle would generate make it unsuitable for much outside the industrial area. It would not be as efficient or as quiet as your home air conditioner for example.

if you want to start a real website, you have to pay for Domain name and Host service. domain name such as yourname.com should be available to be able to register it from www.register.com for example. then you have to pay for a host service. you can use yahoo website packages. if you want to start with a free webspace and address you can open a homepage in geocities.com. it has a file manager and you can upload you files easily. if you use a host service you have to upload your files using FTP tools.
I’d suggest you another approach: (cosx)^2=0.5*(1+cos(2x)); if y’=0 then 1+cos(2x)=0.4*x or cos(2x)=0.4*x-1 (the x=0 is outside of our interval). Now look at the graphs of y1=cos(2x) and that of y2=0.4x-1; |cos(2x)|<=1; ‘start’ point of y2 is [0,-1], y2 is rather ‘slow-up’ and y2 must be <= than 1, ie 0.4*x-1<=1 or x<=5; thus our interval is not (0,10) any longer, it is (0,5]; \n5=1.59*pi; 1.59 is the # of periods of y1 in 5, because 1 period of y1 is 2x=2*pi and x=pi.\nThus there are only 3 critical points in the interval (0,10)!

I have had almost the same problem except it was my own brother. His wife was a bitch on wheels. Rude and unsociable to anyone. We tried to be nice, invited her on vacations you name it. We even tried to talk to my brother about the way she was but he didn't want to hear it, even though he knew we were right. After being married for 7 years he came to his senses and divorced her. Yeah! It was a great day. So my advice to you is, let him be for now. He will come to his senses; hopefully in less than 7 years. Its better to let him figure it out on his own then lose a brother over an argument about it.

It depends on the rate of decomposition. Example: In warm moist areas the body will decompose quickly since bacteria thrive in those conditions. However, in dry or cold conditions, decomposition will take a bit longer. I have seen a picture of a elephant seal that died in the tundra over 300 years ago and it is still not decomposed.
yup, they did. thats just science. its been proven scientifically. however, the bible teaches us that man is flawed, right? well, the bible was written by men, a few hundred years after jesus died. so, isnt it safe to say that if man is flawed, so is the book he's writing? just because a book says that god made men before animals, and its been proven wrong, that doesnt mean that we werent still created by a greater power, or for a specific purpose. i think ppl are too worried about the book having every word be literally true, and not concerned enough with going through the day trying to be a good person.
The buzz around Daughtry for weeks has been that he could end up as Fuel's lead singer. \n\nIt's NOT official (yet), but Fuel's bass player, Jeff Abercrombie, and guitarist Carl Bell, made their pitch on the TV show "Extra" by saying:\n\n"Chris, if you are watching, we've talked about this before, and if you want to entertain it again we'll take it and go".\n\nOn a past Idol show, he performed one of Fuel's songs, "Hemorrhage" just to impress them...

I believe codependency is a situationally, developed sickness (and it IS a sickness), a "learned behavior" stemming from lack of self esteem, self-centered ego (eg: everything that happens must be caused by me, to me, fixed by me, etc.). It's actually a deep rooted issue of needing to control (everybody, everything, etc.). "Dependency" is a whole new category of sickness. Both require professional and/or spiritual treatment.
Things that look darker when soaked absorb water. The surface tension of water brings the small particles (fibre of a cloth or sand-dust) close 2 each other. As a result the density of the wet thing increases. This causes the object 2 reflect light of a different (greater?) wavelength & the colour darkens.

Yes, and it is doing so at the moment. In July 2005, the Chinese government relaxed trading controls on the Chinese yuan, prior to this US$1= Y8.25, now today US$1=Y8.04 (a net decrease of 2½%). \n\nAs a result of this the main Chinese stock exchange (The Shanghai Composite) has rallied from 1,060 to 1,250 (17.9%) compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which has increased from 10,390 to 11,021 in the same time frame (+6.1%)). So it would appear that the loosing of controls on the yuan has benefited Chinese stocks, but that those gains are tempered by the lack of performance in the US
it depends on a lot of factors. laws vary from state to state. were you on FMLA? did you want to work a different schedule when you return or were you available to return to work under the same conditions before you left. for instance - did you work full time and now want to work part time? check with your local unemployment office.
NO. You need to realize when you finance a car, the finance company in essence owns the car. That is why they have the title to it and you don't. What you need to do is as soon as possible call them and explain the situation. Most companies will work out something with you to help out for a few months while you look for new income.\nThe only other options you have is to sell the car, or allow the bank to repossess it. Repossession is the last resort because it destroys your credit and the bank doesn't want the hassle of auctioning the car at a loss.

Stanozolol (Winstrol, or affectionatel called winny, Deca for Deca-Durabolin, Dura for Durabolin et al.) is not the same as Orastan-E.\n\nStanozolol is a FDA controled anabolic/androgenic steroid and Orastan-E by Gaspari is ... well simply put a "designer vitamin". They call it proto-hormone and there is absolutely no detailed information available on it.\n\nThe general feedback on it is that does add mass.\n\nIf you take oral Stanozolol, your liver after a too many cycles will be shot. The question is, how many cycles are too many for your body?

Kidney stones (renal calculi or nephrolithiasis) are pieces of minerals found in the kidneys. They may stay in the kidney or travel out of the body through the urinary tract—the tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) and lead outside the body (urethra). When traveling through the urinary tract, a stone may cause no pain or cause great pain and other symptoms. Kidney stones usually do not cause any long-term damage to the urinary tract.

You would need to be granted emancipation by a court. \n\nEmancipation laws vary by state and not all states have an emancipation statute, which doesn’t mean that you can’t petition for it, because you can pretty ask the court for whatever you want, but in those states there is no actual ‘procedure’ in place.\n\nYou need to check the laws of your state. At a minimum you would be required to prove that you are capable of fully supporting yourself--paying for rent/utilities/food/medical expenses/etc with no assistance from anyone. You would also have to provide a *valid* reason that emancipation would be in your best interest. The court could require other things as well.\n\nThe court can deny emancipation for any reason that it sees fit, including, but not limited to, their belief that you lack the maturity/ability to function as an adult.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is not a quick or easy process, and more often than not, it is denied.

This brought tears to my eyes. No you're definately not obsessive. You're definately in love. The kind of love that most people only dream about or see in movies!!!! This is a tough one to answer or to give advice. But this is my advice. Take one day at a time, don't give up on her ever. Always be there for her through these hard times. 15 is kind of young to marry. I don't know how old you are. But you could get engaged to her. Just appreciate ever moment you have with her. And if something does happen to her, and I pray for both of you it doesn't. You then have truly loved and not really lost her because she'll always be in your heart. It's not like a breakup with someone. You wouldn't have been able to help the parting of the two of you. Just pray to God which I'm sure you do everyday that she gets better. In the mean time just enjoy every moment with her. And if anything did happen you will find the strength through God to go on. You seem religious he'll help you through. And believe it or not a guy like you would find love again someday. I know you don't want to hear this but I'm just saying if it happened you won't blow away!!!! I'll pray for both of you and God bless you both hon!!!!!!

Chapter 7 is a liquidation action. There is no bankruptcy repayment plan per se, but the trustee gathers together all of the debtor's non-exempt assets and sells them and distributes them to the creditors in accordance to the bankruptcy code.\n\nChapter 11 is a reorganization action usually involving partnerships or corporations and very occasionally individuals. A chapter 11 debtor usually proposes a plan of reorganization to keep its business alive and pay creditors over time.\n\nA great overview can be found here:\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/bankruptcycourts/bankruptcybasics.html

If you have a small compus, as used by the early age sailors, you will see the north is indicated at northen pole, even if you make it rorate, it will come back to its position again and show the north direction. Once you reach the exact north pole, then the compus will not work, it will keep rotating as the magnetic lines will pass through and thus you will know that you are at exact north pole.... and same is true for south pole as well ... hope I have answered your question... :)

I assume that you are referring to Fermats Last Theorem - it is very simple : This equation \n\nx to the power of n + y to the power of n equals z the power of n\n\nhas no solution for non-zero integers x, y, and z if n is an integer greater than 2. \n\nWhat is so controversial about this is Fermat proposed this equation and claimed to have come up with a way to prove that this is correct in the margin of his notes. However, he didn't write down his proof. It was, however finally proved (the 90's I think).\n\n\nNever heard of Harmdats theory though and a quick search on google turns up nothing - are you sure you have the name right?\n\nEDIT : It just occurred to me that you could be refering to Fermats Little Theorem. This is less known but used far more regularly. It is used to test if large numbers are not prime. Basically, it states that, \n\nx to the power of (p-1) = 1 mod p\n\nwhere p is a prime which is not a factor of x and p is greater than a which is greater than or equal to 1. If this is false for any value of x then p is not prime.\n\nAlthough this is true for all primes however it is also true for some non-primes. Therefore this can only be used to prove that a number is definitely NOT a prime, not that it is definitely a prime.

I guess that people who hate God have never really known Him.\n\nI was a full blown son of satan, though I had been raised as a believer, I too wanted to Sex drugs Rock and Roll and rejected my parents and their teaching. I didn't want to be like them.\n\nAnyhow, I was listening to Handel's Messiah and was interested in the words...\n\nIsa 53:1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? \nIsa 53:2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. \nIsa 53:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \nIsa 53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. \nIsa 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. \nIsa 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. \nIsa 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. \nIsa 53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. \nIsa 53:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. \nIsa 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. \nIsa 53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. \nIsa 53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. \n\nwell, it made my heart burn to even think of it. I knew it was Him in me. So I repented, believing the scriptures were from him, and He has rewarded me every step of the way.\n\nI was as good as buried in a federal prison (I did 30 years)and he picked me up, way up to ride upon his shoulders (like the Josh Groban song "You raise me up"...http://www.goldinc.com/~lizzie/momscd/) from the bottom of a solitary cell behing locked doors and barbed wire fences and armed guards. He taught me obedience to Him means obedience to the authorities. I stopped dope because he showed me it as a terrible bondage. It's been great; a little tough, growing up finally, but it's still great.\n\nWhat's people's problem with God? I dunno. I guess they're angry about some of their hurts and blame God...\n\nHappy you're whole now, keep on being thankful for it all.\n\nloved your question.

Remember when you FIRST enter the page, there is no such thing about the variable $do since $_POST array does not exist!\n\nI see multiple problems over there.\n- Your form has the method of POST, so why do you use GET ?\n + $do=$_GET['do']; should be $do=$_POST['do'];\n- Now since the variable do does not exist you could do a simple if statement that checks that. The function isset checks if that variable exists.\n + $do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n- But there is another problem, The hidden name for do does not exist.. So lets change it to do\n + <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n\n[now the overall code]\n=============================\n<html>\n<body>\n<?php\n\n// Lets initialize the variable\n$do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n\n// Lets just display the current Action\necho 'ACTION:'.$do;\n\n// Check if the hidden variable was sent\nif ($do == 'send') {\n\n // Lets print out the post array\n var_dump($_POST);\n\n} else { ?>\n <form method="POST" action="">\n <p><input type="submit" value="Submit" name="submit"></p>\n <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n </form>\n<?php } ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n=============================\nI took out the other forms...\n\nThe above should work.. Now.. But why introduce another variable if you already have the submit variable intact? What you could do is say $do = isset($_POST['submit']) ? 'send' : 'Submit'; That will remove that hidden field. Another thing I realize is that your mixing HTML code with PHP code which is BAD PRACTICE. I recommend you to at least separate them, or if you don't want to use a templating engine, I recommend you do at least store the output in one variable like outvar = "". That will take out alot of issues in the future.\n\nAnyways.. Good Luck

Hi Piglet,!!\nI'm a man of 58, and I have had artherosclerocis for some time.\nIt's time you saw your GP and talk to him about what you have to do to , first reduce any high cholesterol that you may have, and also ask him/her about products that relax the muscles of the affected arteries and also the heart muscle.You are at risk of heart attack or stroke if you don;t start some life changes, including some drug therapy.\nDon't waste any time, your life could depend on it.\nOnce you have got your cholesterol under control, and your doctor has given you some drug therapy to follow, a change to eating healthy food, and a regular cardiovascular workout, usually a good brisk walk for about 20minutes a day will keep you pretty right, and reduce your risks of heart attack or stroke.\nFirst see your doctor`.\nRegards and good luck\n\nPS. don't smoke.\n\npa69oldfart.

Christianity is the fastest decling religion. U are right, EUrope's population is declining because every woman is giving birth to 1.3 kids in average. And there population is decreasing. \n\nSecondly, Christians are converting into Atheism, Agnostic, and Islam. If population is the main cause for the decline of Christianity in Europe, then Islam and Athiesm is the cause for its decline in North America.\n\nCanada for example was 90% Christian, and now recent study say that 60-70% are Christians. In Toronto there is a mosque in which christians convert to Islam daily.

It is a duty of a Moslem to give a contribution to the State. It is separate from the Jizya (poll tax that is levied on non-Moslems.\n\n"Zakat (Obligatory Charity) is one of the major 5 duties required by God from all the submitters (Muslims in Arabic). The others being the Shahada (declaration of faith), Salat (contact prayers), Fasting the month of Ramadan and Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca). "\n\n"The Jizya or poll tax is a personal tax levied on non-Moslems in a Moslem State, and as such it resembles the Zakat (Alms Tax) which is levied on Moslem citizens by the Moslem State. The poll tax is levied so that all the capable non-Moslem citizens of the State can contribute, each from his own money, to the general welfare of the State, and that in return for this, they can enjoy their rights as nationals of this State, including compensation from the Moslem Exchecquer when they are in need."\n\n(7:156)"My mercy encompasses all things, but I will specify it for the righteous who give Zakat" \n\n[3:134] "who give to charity during the good times, as well as the bad times."\n\n[6:141] " ……….. give the due alms (Zakat) on the day of harvest, and do not waste anything. He does not love the wasters."

Let me state a few facts that may be unclear or distorted by the false image the media creates; Islam as a religion doesn't approve of killing innocent ppl, regardless of their color, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, etc....\n\nArabs or those living in countries that speak Arabic can be non-muslims as well, like in many countries I've been to for e.g. Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria, & Jordan there are many Christinans who belong to diff. sects, & there are still a minority of Jews living there cos it's their home.\n\nTo answer your question, I think that violence will help solve nothing, it will breed more hatered & distruction regardless of it being unorganized like the WTC attacks or organized like the invation of Iraq where also thausands of innovent Christian & Muslim Iraqis died since it began.\n\nI hope i helped....May tom. be a better day

Let g = # of girls in the math club last year\n(which is what we're looking for)\nand b = # of boys in the math club last year\n\ng + b = 75, or b = 75 - g\n1.25g + 1.4b = 99\n\nTherefore,\n1.25g + 1.4(75 - g) = 99\n1.25g + 105 - 1.4g = 99\n105 - 0.15g = 99\n-0.15g = -6\ng = 40 (which means b = 35)\n\nChecking my work:\nA growth of 25% for girls would mean the number of girls went from 40 to 1.25*40, which is 50.\nA growth of 40% for boys would mean the number of boys went from 35 to 1.4*35, which is 49.\nAnd 50 + 49 = 99.
Since the pigment within the membrane of the beets are colored red, it's good to test the stress caused on the membrane. The more damage to the membrane, the more color it gives off. Put the beet in the solution that you are going to test in.\n\nPersonally, I tested heat and acid. \nIn general, extreme heat will cause more stress on the membrane than extreme heat. This can be easily observed by the naked eye. \nAcetone has a greater ability to dissolve lipids than methanol, the acetone solvent will cause greater stress on the membrane

Doing your own god damn homework.
Transmutation is a little used English word and biological term. In plain English, it means to change the nature of something. In biology, it means to change one species into another species; "speciation" is more commonly used. Transmutation is commonly used in nuclear physics where it refers to changing one element into another by changing the element's nucleus.\n\nIn the book, "Macroevolution" Steven Stanley lists a half dozen confirmed speciation events which occurred in modern times.\n\nOne classic example of beneficial mutations is the peppered moth. In its original form, about half of individuals were light and half dark. When pollution darkened tree trunks, the light peppered moths stood out and were preferentially eaten. The composition of the population shifted to mostly dark colored moths with only a few percent light colored ones.\n\nAdditions to the genetic code of a species occur when an error during reproduction results in (1) part of the species' DNA is copied twice and (2) DNA from another species is incorporated.\n\nIcarus62's three statements do deal with mIcroevolution. What you don't understand, is that mIcroevolution is simply mAcroevolution observed over a short time. Read his question!! Basically, he was saying, "We all agree that mIcroevolution occurs. Given this, what is to stop mAcroevolution from occuring?" \n\nTo be taken seriously, creationists will have to do something other than nitpick at evolutionary theory. They must develop theories of their own. Creationists are a laughingstock because they make no attempt at generating testable scientific theories, and then testing them.\n\nIcarus62, good job!
This is connected primarily to faith in Allaah. All religions are agreed that it is not permissible for a woman to have intercourse with anyone except her husband. Among these religions are those which are undoubtedly of heavenly origin, such as Islam and the original versions of Judaism and Christianity. Belief in Allaah dictates submission to His rulings and laws, for Allaah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, He knows what is in the best interests of mankind. So we may understand the wisdom behind the ruling of sharee’ah, or we may not be able to grasp it. \n\nWith regard to the permissibility of multiple spouses for men and its prohibition for women, there are several issues which are obvious to every intelligent person. Allaah has made woman like a vessel, but man is not like that. If a woman becomes pregnant (when she has had intercourse with a number of men at one time), the father can never be known. People’s lines of descent and lineage will be mixed up, families will be destroyed and children will be lost. Women will be burdened with so many children that they will be unable to bring them up and spend on their maintenance. Maybe women would find themselves forced to sterilize themselves, which would lead to the extinction of the human race. Moreover it is medically proven now that one of the major causes of the serious diseases which have become widespread, such as AIDS etc., is women having intercourse with more than one man, and the mixing of seminal fluids in the woman’s womb causes these lethal diseases. Hence Allaah has prescribed a waiting period (‘iddah) for a woman who has been divorced or whose husband has died, until enough time has passed for her womb and passages to be cleansed of any traces of her former husband, and the monthly period also has a role to play in this matter. Perhaps these brief pointers will dispense with the need for a lengthy discussion. If the purpose of the question is research for a university or other assignment, he may refer to the books which have been written on the topic of plural marriage (polygyny) and the wisdom behind it. And Allaah is the Source of strength.
It is just a distraction that all. Do you really think Bin Laden who was a CIA asset does not know how we operate. Give me a break.

That's a good question, and even though I'm American, I'm still not offended, since I don't think that the US is the center of the world. (Also, I hate baseball.) However, in response to your remark about Americans lacking culture, all I have to say is that I bet you really enjoy listening to our music and watching our movies and TV shows. (By the way, why is it that you Brits watched more "Baywatch" than we Yanks ever did?)

"The difference between a regular optical mouse and a laser mouse is the light used to track movement. A regular optical mouse uses an LED light in the optical engine, while a laser mouse uses a laser to track movement. The more dots per inch (dpi) a mouse can track, the more sensitive and accurate it is. A typical optical mouse tracks between 400dpi and 800dpi, while laser mice track more than 2,000dpi. "

Everyone gets their period when they are ready, generally between the ages of 8 and 17. Don't worry about it. You should be glad it hasn't come yet, hun, cuz it is awful...But I have absolutely no idea why your doctor would say you might have to take pills because you don't have your period yet! This is perfectly normal. Everyone's body is different. I got mine when I was 12 (now I'm 14), some of my friend's got it when they were like 10, and others haven't gotten it yet. It's not a big deal if you haven't had it yet. Don't worry. Talk to a female adult you can trust if you're truly paranoid about this, you need some reassurance. And, just be aware then when you do get your period it can be very irregular, you may even skip months at a time. If you don't know a whole lot about periods I would suggest talking to a female adult you can trust so you know what to expect. Don't worry, hun, you're fine and there's absolutely nothing wrong with you at all. I said it before, but it's important, just remember everyone's body is different. There is no "right" age to get your period or a "correct" cycle.
This is dependent on a few things, in order of importance (to me at least):\n1. How much money do you have to spend on an ADC\n2. What is the input frequency range you want to capture\n3. What kind of accuracy are you looking for\n\nAs you answer those questions, start looking at how different ADCs compare against what you need. A good place to start looking is http://www.digikey.com , which sells all sorts of ADCs.
Yes it is true that elves or dwarfs exist. Elves don't but dwarfs do. Congenital dwarfism is actually termed skeletal or chondrodysplasia and is literally premature closure of the growth plates or failure of the long bones to form properly. Sometimes it is a genetic defect that interferes with bone growth, sometimes a pituitary disorder.

I have worked with teachers who have done the Global course and the LTTC courses and they both have similar approaches to their work but neither opted for the full practical option as part of their respective courses.\nThe Cambridge CELTA and the Trinity College (London) TESOL are certainly the most widely known in Europe and elsewhere. It does depend on where you are thinking of teaching next and if you intend to make English teaching your career, at least for a few years.
its very hard to stop thinking about someone you love eventhough they may not want you anymore! believe me i did the same thing. the reason why we do it is because we want something that we cant have. we as human beings, want what we cant have! that is why you keep thinking about wanting to be with him. trust me, you will get over him and you will stop thinking about him. it just takes time. to keep your mind off of him, try hanging out with friends and do some different activities to keep him off your mind. believe me, you will eventually! good luck!
Oh my God. I swear he is SO yummy! Isnt he? God, have you seen him lately! Wow! \n\nAnd his lyrics. I swear I just want to hug the guy and take care of him. That sounds insane, I know, but everything he has been through just makes me sad. I just want to take care of him. I am just pulled toward him. I dont know why. \n\nIm not stalking the guy or anything but I am very drawn to him. I just love the guy!
the most simple and obvious answer is you can't....but you can control your actions!!!\nwhen you feel that you are falling for someone you shouldn't be falling for, then simply stop meeting him, don't call or recieve his phonecalls...just cut off all sorts of communications with him....\nwe can't control our feelings, but we can stop them from growing...\nGood luck

I am very proud of how Bynum and my man Lamar played today, they did some pretty shit out there. \n\nBut lets make this very clear, once I come back from this stupid injury, our offense should involve ME and only ME! I don't care about the triangle! I am the only one deserving to shoot the ball and my teammates better be cooperative and they should pass the ball to ME everytime they touch it or i'll let them here it. Anyway, I predict a very wonderful season for ME and I assure my billions of fans that I will win the scoring title easily. So keep on worshipping ME like I'm your God cuz I will surely reward you by shooting the ball even more. Peace!

i think you mean:\n"why DO Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and other democrats (no E) WANT to ruin california?" \n\nyeah, that would suck if california could pollute less, and if ppl with money could share it with those less fortunate. how dare they share their ideas, what did they ever do for the country (besides establish an exceptionally peaceful stance with foreign nations, and create the biggest budget surplus in history) ?\ni'd much rather go fight old enemies in Iraq (that dick cheney was business partners with), on pretenses that they have weapons (that they didnt have), while ignoring the nations that DO have "nucular" weapons. and its a good thing we're trying to ban gay marriage.... liberty and justice for straight white land owning christian males, and everyone else should have fewer rights.... that will help keep america safer...... hey, where did Osama go by the way? anyone remember that?\n\nand if you want to talk about spending, NOBODY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD has spent more than Bush's Cabinet. he can say "well, we created tax cuts", but the richest 1% saved the most, while the rest of us are getting poorer. housing is down, the auto industry is down, pollution is up, we're in the biggest budget deficit in history.... and he's saying "unemployment is the best its been in 5 years". well, it was better a little more than 6 years ago...

Hmm does it really matter how much they are being paid? If they play well, then what's the problem. It's only money.\n\nHowever, in a more global aspect, I think that when a successful organization is making a profit, they have other obligations to pay attention to. Since payroll is the highest expense in any organization, and there is a profit happening from somewhere, the obligation is to the community and those that are not as fortunate. It doesn't matter to me how much a player makes. If the player is good, has skill, and has alot to offer the team then so be it. I would also like to see the teams also contribute to their communities and states. (And most do - even those highly paid players do as well.)

He would definately gain muscle. Cardio really isnt great for building muscle- especially if you are doing it for a long time (running distance, biking long ways, etc). Cardio is an equal opportunity burner of stored energy- which is both fat and muscle mass. There are a couple of problems with fat guys doing only lifting. The first is that you're a lot more likely to have a heart attack or annurism while lifting if you're real heavy. The second is that you're not going to look cut when you're fat- the fat just sits on top of the muscle and hides it, so you still look fat, not cut.

They're complaining because they need something to complain about. They complained that bush didn't "connect the dots" and let 911 happen a few months after he took office, then they complain about the patriot act and wiretapping phone calls to foreign terrorists. They complain because they want a political advantage. Even the no child left behind act, which ted kennedy helped write, they complain about because they don't want Bush to be able to get credited for anything. They're so phony and obvious.

NO GOD. A number of reasons:\n\n1) No proof -- the bible is 2000 years old. We dont no who wrote it, and it is extremely contradictory, and in some places prejudice (ie against gay's).\n2) Humans -- people say that humans are proof of God, but there are other theories which are tested and questioned. Evolution has stood up to a number of arguments and is frequently questioned and always proved correct.\n3) The Big Bang -- This too has been tested -- evidence is Red Shift (i think that's what its called). People ask where gases came from to create the big bang, but where would God have come from?\n4) Scientists -- Scientists are extremely clever people and the majority of them say no God, and who better to trust? (Certainly not a man who wears a dog collar).\n5) Suffering -- If God is all caring and all powerful how does suffering happen?\n6) Can God create a boulder that's too heavy for God to lift? -- Yes- he's all powerful so can create anything. No- He's all powerful so can lift anything. Therefore the basic idea of God completely destroys any possibility of God.\n7) Why believe in something which has such little proof - it would be like saying that the matrix is real - we cant prove or disprove it - just like God.\n8) Next to no one believes in the old Roman God's, so why do we think that this God is not going to be lost like the other ones?\n9) Cause and effect. Everything has a cause, and the causes of all effects will eventually lead back to God, however what happens if we say "what caused God"?\n10) Our Responses -- Those who believe in God will say things like "we are proof" or "the bible in proof" or "because he exists". They give no evidence unlike people who dont believe in God who put their ideas forward with good and sensible arguments.
It is Ming-ga-la-pa. But they don't normally say it. They just smile at each other when they meet.
Literacy is one of the fastest changing arenas in education today. The very idea that literacy simply means the ability to read and write is no longer valid (though that is what the word literally means). The new ideas of literacy focus on students' individual prior knowledge, how they use that prior knowledge to navigate through particular subject matter and finally what the student is able to accomplish. I have even heard talk (and I don't by into this much, but it is the 'buzz') that literacy doesn't necessarily mean being able to read about baseball, but if the student can tell you about baseball and play baseball, even if they can't read about baseball, is still somewhat literate in that subject.\n\nWhat does this mean for Language teachers? Hmmm, I don't think it means much other that we have to modify how we view our assesment of student achievement. We have to be a little more open and creative when monitoring and assessing the education progress of each student taking into account (and being more cognizant of) individual learning styles and modalities. \n\nThis is a good thing in the fact that you can, with a little (lot) more effort reach more of your students...but it also gives the legislature more slosh room for "NCLB" standards and benchmarks. We still, as Language teachers, have to focus on the reading and writing, but the legislation says that we, and esp. if the IEP states, can now take grades and make alternative assessments if if the child in question is unable to do the classical showing of proficiency (as long as they can, in some way show they have learned the material).\n\nSo, I am not sure if I answered the question as you would have liked. I am in the habit of being verbose and this particular area can get pretty heavy between petagogy, philosophy, legislation, and personal vision. All in all the effort is to try and make sure all students are able to show a certain amount of proficiency in a myriad of ways...while (by some miracle) being able to perform adaquately on their particular state's madatory assessment tool.\n\nTO me...I still do my job and expect my students to know and be able to do everything I ask of them...even if it is hard. I follow state mandates regarding benchmarks, IEP's, ESOL, etc... I do engage in alternative assessment, but it still is a language class...thus they, in the end, have to be able to read, comprehend and compose proficiently.
Chief Minister is Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, born in 1949, popularly known as Y.S.R.\nHe is known for his forthright speech and frank approach. Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy hails from Pulivendula, a small town from Cuddapah district of the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDr.Reddy belongs to the Indian National Congress party and was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Pulivendula Assembly Constituency of Cuddapah District. He has been Chief Minister since May 14, 2004. He served as the leader of the Opposition in the House for the previous term during which N. Chandrababu Naidu was the Chief Minister.\n\nY.S.R. is a medical science graduate from the M.R. College of Gulbargaa. He did his House-Surgency in Sri Venkateshwara Medical College, Tirupathi. Upon completion of his MBBS degree, he served as Medical Officer in Church of South India's Campbell Hospital in Jammalamadugu in the Diocese of Nandyal for a brief period of time. In 1973 he established a 70-bed charitable hospital at Pulivendula in the name of his father, Sri Y. S. Raja Reddy. The hospital continues to serve the poor to date.\n\nA doctor by profession, Reddy made his debut in politics as a Youth Congress Leader. It is interesting to note that he and his present opponent, TDP President Nara Chandrababu Naidu, made their debut at the same time (1978) in the Andhra Pradesh State Legislative Assembly as young legislators of the Congress party. They both worked together as Ministers in Sri. Tanguturi Anjaiah’s cabinet. In fact Sri Chandrababu Naidu acknowledges him as his mentor in politics.\n\nY.S.R. had an active political career over a quarter of a century and has been representing his party on different fora. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Cuddapah constituency four times, and a similar number of times to the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly, from the Pulivendula constituency.

okay, the difference here is OEM\n\nmost OEM installs of Windows XP have a license on the side of the box. Microsoft knows the "CD" key number. Because most OEM's are assembled with an Un-keyed version of XP because the Manufacture uses a motherboard that is "tattooed" has the "key" embedded in it.\n\nLet's say you want to put a new motherboard in the PC that is not the original to the PC. And you desire to transfer Win XP to this machine, first the restore disks will not work on a motherboard that is not 'tattooed', second (let's say you get a XP disk) you install XP and attempt to use your 'CD Key' from the side of the box. It will come up that you need to call Microsoft. and the short of it is, that most OEM version's of XP can only be registered on the computer (motherboard) that it shipped with.\n\nhowever, now if you bought a Windows XP O/S and installed it on a computer, and now want to install it on a new computer, back up and copy the data you need to keep. remove XP from the old computer and install it on the new one.

Day dreamer is correct. The profile of the cable is produced with a twist. Distorting it to any other shape than a spiral requires energy, let the cable free and the stored energy used to distort it is used to relax the cable back to its natural shape. Try heating up any plastic object and you find before it goes back to a molten blob it will pass through other shapes ( the shapes it passed through when being produced). Its called inbuilt history. To the rather anal people this is a very general description based on the Q.
A stop codon is a stop signal that terminates transcription. You might know that RNA polymerase transcribes DNA, for the purpose of protein synthesis. When the required gene is fully copied onto the RNA transcript, it recognizes a stop signal when it reads the stop codon. That is when the transcription stops and the mRNA transcript cuts off from the DNA. \nStop codon is very crucial because without a stop signal the whole DNA would be transcribed, which is a great waste of time and cell energy. \nI hope that helped....

The first thing, as a female...she's probably incredibly insecure about his, even though it's not her fault. No doubt she misses a healthy sex life, but because you are so important to one another, she's probably feeling a little scared that this is going to ruin one of the greatest things in her life. So while it's important, you have to make sure she knows that it's not AS important as the relationship the two of you have. And don't just say it once, remind her. We girls like to be reassured, because doubt tends to get the better of us. And don't just say it, make sure your actions support what you say. Once she's feeling better about herself, explore a temporary non-vaginal-intercourse alternative to abstinence - by talking about it together, being positive and enthusiastic, and by experimenting, which can be loads of fun for a change of pace. Don't make it about the problem, make it about how fun it can be finding a solution. You may even find that it makes your sex life better in the long-term by having variety there.

If you want an audio clip, it can most likely be found on a p2p file sharing system like LimeWire. I found the audio clip from there but it was a long time ago. They may also have the video clip but you can never tell what will surface from one search to another. Thats the best I can offer you. Or find a way to record it yourself from the dvd. I used to have an mp3 player that would plug into devices and record the current playing audio. I got a lot of movie audio clips that way.
Mistake, yes. To think that you're set with Kitna and McNown is insane. Neither is a franchise QB. Leinart is. I expect Leinart to be starting by week five and to win between five and six games, right around .500. Next year AZ will probably draft him that dump out TE optioin and he'll win 9. Year three puts AZ in the playoffs if they can get a touch of defensive help.

Yes it does happen but I think less often these days. \n\nIn the extreme exertion of a marathon the body loses fluids, electrolytes (salts) and tends to overheat. If a runner gets to a state of extreme dehydration and exhaustion the muscles that retain the 'poo' simply let go involuntarily.\n\nWith more knowlegeable runners, proper diet and hydration I think that this phenomena is now mostly behind us.

What kind of designer are you? Photo, video, cad?\n\nIf you're doing photoshop or video editing, you don't need much of a graphics card, just memory. Well, maybe not. You'll still need the graphics card for the gaming though.\n\nIf you're a cad designer, you will need to get a good workstation graphics card (nVidia QuadroFX Go 1400 is the best for laptops). Unfortunately, it's not half as good as the desktop QuadroFX 4500 or most of the newer gaming graphics card. If you're really going for the high end, you could get a laptop with an ATI Radeon X800 or X1800 and softmod it, but it's pretty risky. The X1800 might not even be softmod-able. However, even without the softmod, it'll still be pretty fast for OpenGL, not to mention much cheaper than the QuadroFX Go 1400.\n\nFor designing, you'll want a LOT of memory. 2 GIGs is usually fine for anything besides extensive video editing.\n\nYou'll also want a dual-core CPU. AMD Turion X2 is fine, as with the newer centrinos. They aren't the fastest, but they'll keep your laptop cool enough to let the maximum power out of your graphics card and memory.\n\nMid-range solution: The best would be the Dell E1705. Configure it with the 2nd fastest dual-core CPU, 2GIG ram, the GeForce Go 7900 GS. You can check Dealnews.com periodically for Dell deals. They usually post a $750 coupon weekly. The complete system will cost you about $1500-1800. This laptop will run almost as fast as the high-end solutions below. It's by far the best bang for the buck.\n\nHigh-end solutions: An Alienware, Dell XPS M1710, or Sager laptop with an nVidia Go 7900 GTX (http://www.powernotebooks.com/category.php?catId=26#id1415). I would avoid the Alienware and Dell XPS setups because they will be at least $1000 more expensive than the Sager model. However, they're usually better built and have better cooling. If you really want to shell out 50% more money for a 20% gain in quality/speed, go for them. But there's no guarentee that you're going to get anything close to what you're paying for.

i find myself in an ideal position to answer this question.\n\nRecently me and my girlfriend had split up. We had been having sex while dating and now since we've broken up, we've decided that as long as we're single, we should enjoy the occasional sex (which is becoming more and more frequent). Most people will tell yo that to have sex you must be committed and it should be for love blah blah blah... \nI say this, if you both enjoy it and you both understand the rules, WHY NOT?
Maybe not her but some other woman out there.United States never had a female president how can this country continue to say this is a free country equal oppaturnity enployer.(I know it's spelled wrong) when I woman can't run for president.Where does it say that it has to be a man that runs this country.I as a woman would like to see a woman be the PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.She would bring our young men and women TROOPS home.

I assume you are talking about Jeremy HERMIDA.... There are many factors involved in this situation. \n1) He has never played a complete MLB season.\n2) He is still very young\n3) His team is in a rough situation with a possible move.\n\nI took him in my first draft this season as a 4th outfielder ( Sleeper Pick )....... If he can prove that he belongs in the MLB and his YOUNG team can get things going.... he could be an OUTSTANDING starter on my team....
Boy. There are a lot of people answering this question who really don't know the rules in this country. I speak from 11 years of law enforcement experience, many of those specifically developing traffic offenses into greater crimes. So people don't think I am feeding you a line of police BS, I included the laws that established each of the rights and reasons to search. Feel free to research them yourself so you can see I am giving you the straight scoop.\n\nThere are many times when the police can search your entire car, including your trunk, glove box, and even locked containers within your car, without a warrant. I'll lay out four of the most common techniques I use to search cars.\n\n(1) Consent. Can't go wrong here. If you ask for consent to search and the driver (or person in charge of the vehicle) gives you consent, you can search the entire vehicle. The consenting party has the authority to withdraw their consent and/or limit the areas you can search.\n\nOn reasons (2) through (4) consent makes no difference. If the police can meet one of these requirements, they will legally search your car with or without your consent.\n\n(2) Probable Cause. If you develop probable cause during a traffic stop, you may search the vehicle without a warrant. This is commonly called the "motor vehicle exception" to the search warrant rule. The authority for the police to do so was first established under a US supreme court case called Carroll v. United States. The courts have since expanded on this case and allowed the police to search items within the vehicle regardless of who claims ownership of the items. Under this technique, the police can only search areas where it is reasonable to believe the contraband they are searching for may be found. For example, if the police believe they are lookng for a rifle, they would not be able to search a purse. However, if they find the rifle and now believe they might be looking ammunition, the search of the purse is good.\n\n(3) Pursuant to arrest. If the police arrest you for a bookable offense while operating a motor vehicle, they may search the areas under your control (including the passenger compartment and possibly other areas of the car) for contraband or weapons that you may have discarded. This authority is established under case law named Chimel v. California.\n\n(4) Inventory search - If the police have the authority to tow your car, they may search it under the premise that they need to inventory all items contained within the car prior to towing the car. These searches were upheld under the community caretaking doctrine established under South Dakota v. Opperman.\n\nThere are other ways to get into a car. Too many to go into here. Truthfully, there is almost NEVER a time when the police need a warrant to search a car. In my 11 years, I think I have obtained a warrant for two or three of the probably 1000 cars I have searched, and those cars were firmly secured in the police impound lot pending the warrant.
Divide 100 into 2 numbers, for instance 50 and 2. Write those down. 2 is a prime number, so cannot be divided further. Divide 50 into 2 numbers. Write down all the prime numbers you have. You should end up with 5 x 5 x 2 x 2 for your final answer. If you multiply these prime numbers together, you get 100! Do similar problems the same way.

I practice Vodou. It is a religion that focuses on helping, healing, the community, and family. To use lwa you must know how to petition them. There are no spells in Vodou. There is working with the spirits, the lwa. We ask the lwa to help us. We give them offerings and they in turn help us with what we need. \n\nBaron Samedi is the lwa of the cemetery. He is the one to call is someone is very sick or dieing. This is because he controls life and death. If you need to ask for help from the lwa you need to speak with a Mambo or Hougan, they are the priests of the religion. They can petition the lwa for you. There is always a charge for the service though. Some Mambos will allow you to make amends some other way if you can not pay.\n\nYou can also try to use wiccan or hoodoo spells. I will look through my books and email one to you. I would prefer not to post on this.
Because you cannot please all of the people all of the time, politicians who do try to do the right things usually only last one term. The only politician I can genuinely say I still have respect for is Colin Powell. As a soldier he went in front of the U.N. and followed his Commander in Chief's orders and tried to sell a bill of goods that even Powell didn't believe in. If you watch a replay of that farce you can see by his body language how uncomfortable he was. I respect his integrity for following his boss's orders but in case you all forgot, he resigned as soon as he could afterwards and unlike a lot of former politicians, he hasn't blamed everyone else for things he did. Unlike his boss's and cronies, Powell knew the cost of war, he has been there. To go from him to "Condi" shows the true ineptness of this administration. Can't say I've witnessed a lot of honesty lately, but Powell was dedicated and respected the world over. And still is...

It does help a bit, but not that much. It's equivalent to playing JV soccer. I know someone who was Eagle Scout, top ten in class, and decent at hockey, but still ended up going to URI. Someone else ranked lower than him got into Amherst and Brown because he was the editor-in-chief of the school literary magazine and captain of XC. As you can see, Eagle Scout is not weighted as much as some of the other extra-curriculars. Because not everyone can afford the money to be in boy scouts, but anyone can be the editor as long as she/he works really hard at it.
George W. Bush is a multifaceted man. He is definitely a social conservative--and in that, he and I have absolutely nothing in common--, but he is also not a raging nationalist (and I celebrate the latter, especially with regards to immigration). He is pro big business, but he is not an economic conservative (his administration's spending is extraordinarily high). It also is the case that there have been spectacular changes between the two administrations he's lead. The first four years were dominated by dismal decision-making, war-mongering, deception, terrible self-inflicted damage to the image of the US internationally, foolish foreign policy, etc. The second Bush administration has been orders of magnitude better on the foreign policy front, with Condoleeza Rice at the helm (now the US is finally learning to talk to leftist governments in Latin America, for example, rather than to shun and isolate them, creating the sort of resentment that doesn't help the US in the long run).\n\nI have cringed at the Supreme Court nominations of Mr. Bush, particularly that of Samuel Alito. And I am appalled by the reluctance of this administration to set free Gitmo prisoners who have already been tried and found innocent of any wrong-doing. I think there's much more we will learn (hopefully) about domestic spying, and when all is said and done, History will remember Mr. Bush rather unkindly as a President, given his penchant for secrecy, for engaging in serious violations of the law of the land, and for hypocritical political maneuvers like unclassifying classified documents by issuing orders to *leak* the information to the press.\n\nBut Bush the man seems rather affable, and I cannot bring myself to blame him for everything that has gone wrong with his administration. He gives me the impression of being somewhat incompetent for the position he holds, of being stubborn to the point of stupidity--like Stephen Colbert said yesterday nigh, the Presiden is a man who believes on Wednesday what he believed on Monday, despite what happened on Tuesday--, and of having selective episodes of compassion--as in the case of illegal immigrants--and responsibility--as was the case when Mr. Bush, to my astonishment and profound delight--came out in support of the Muslim American community, calling on citizens not to make our plight into a religious conflict.

I was raped by my x. He got 8 months in jail while i recieved the rest of my life with the most beautiful girl. I tried abortion and was unable to finish it. \nTake this as a sign from God that there is a reason for this child. If you are unable to keep it than yes adopt the child out. \nThe child you carry could very well save the world from cancer, come up with the next treatment for sever retardation in children, or invent the most increadible machine ever. \n\nWhat we choose to do makes a differance in the future. This has happened for a reason. Go see a doctor, take prenatal vitamans take care of yourself and this baby. The child living through the abortion pills and inseres makes me believe that this child is wanting to live. That should have been enough signs but if you are anything like myself I was takingin home preg tests up till 2 weeks before my daughter was born. I though it would go away. \nI laugh at this now 12 years later. I know you are scared and worrid about what this child may turn out like, but believe me if i have learned nothing in the last 13 years it is that God has a plan. I may not know what it is but I do know that when I look at the child i carried i still thank God she lived thought the last 13 years of her life. \n\nI spent the first 9 months trying to figure out how to get rid of this child, and since have spent the last 12 years 3 months trying to figure out how to save her from the tormoils of the world. \n\nTeenage years here we come. Take this as a blessing and move on. See a doctor, take care and always believe that the Lord will bring you through what ever you need.\nI often screamed at God telling him that he has forgoten me, does not realize that i am unable to deal with that which he has given me. Then i look at my childs eyes and realize. NOt only did he give me a way to work through the rape, he gave me the most amazing gift any one can have. A child who loves me for me. \n\nGood luck and feel free to email me.

To answer your question: a TRUE republican does respect black people and their culture.However, alot of conservatives that CALL themselves republicans do not. But don't be fooled; a closet racist is not a TRUE republican.\n\nI'm sure you know that Abraham Lincoln, the president who freed the slaves, was a replublican. However, did you know that the Republicans in the senate at the time of the civil war/reconstruction were even more tolerant then Lincoln? They advocated such "radical" proposals as a 'freeman's office' to help get the newly freed slaves on their feet, give them jobs and ensure a right to vote. Their major opposition after Lincoln's death was Lincoln's democratic successor Andrew Johnson.\n\nImmediately following the civil war, many congressional districts in the south went to black candidates (all running under the republican banner.) However, the KKK and other terrorist organizations (many affiliated with the democrats) soon put an end to this early success and it was another 100 years before blacks began to once again recieve true political rights. \n\nSo what about the civil rights movement of the 60's? A purely democratic movement? Not true: the legislation of the late 1950's through 1960's was largely bipartisan and many forget that it was president Dwight Eisenhower (a republican) that helped foster the earliest, and some might say most crucial beginnings of school desegregation in the south.\n\nThe southern realignment of the early 1970's shifting many of the racist southern democrats (or 'dixicrats) to the republican camp is also widely misconstrued as a "switching places" of the two parties.\nFirst of all, only a minority of congressmen held these views and that minority (which is now nearly 100% dead or retired) cannot be called TRUE republicans, since they essentially jumped parties. Second of all, the voter shift in the south can hardly be chalked up to purely racial views, there was a lot of unrest (due to the vietnam war, poor economy, etc) that caused all kinds of demographics to 'switch sides.'\n\nToday, politics is undoubtedly more bitter and hateful then ever. Both parties are guilty of this and race is often brought up as an issue. However, it would be unfair to stereotype either party as not 'liking another race.' So, take this history into account. \n\nPersonally, I come from Kansas where the head of the republican party happens to be an african american, and he's as TRUE a replubican and as strong a leader as I've ever had the honor of meeting.

I believe in love because its all around me, love from God through his Creations, love from Humans, love from myself. Without love I dont think there could be Human life.\n\n Love is a creation, when someone creates something is love to something or to someone, love is one of the most difficult terms to define and one of the most important for humans to socialize and to understand each other.
There are two simple answers. First the customer base would not be willing to pay the cost of the water. Second much of the customer base are environmentally friendly thinking people who do not want any energy consuming/pollution generating industries in there patch of the world.\n\nAlthough it is sad that the resource has not been tapped on a production scale. We are doing pretty well here in Saudi Arabia where we can build a joint Electric Generation plant combined with a Desal plant. They are pretty effective that way.\n\nThere are three main technologies each works to fit a particular service and they are getting quite cost effective.\n\nGood luck convincing people there are better ways.

It could be right next door to you but you'd have to get there. All health clubs are basically crowded when you want to go. If you have a 9 to 5 job and want to get in a quick half hour fat burn or heat rate exercise in then your missing out on all of what a club has to offer. I've been with Bally's total fitness since 1981 and I go just about the time when people are having lunch. Its a different feel when you dont have to wait for a stepper or a stationary bike. I can get more done with less wait time. More often then not a club will promote something just to get new members, I've no clue on what a MAP test is or what it might be used for....but if its an extra cost then the price of your membership just went up... Leave the testing to your doctor and focus on staying in good health with a weekly workout schedule...\nGood Luck...
Tread carefully because your job is first. It sux when your deal goes sour and you live with it. Factors to consider if negative outcome: job expendability, gossip, future promotions, reputation, future relationships. If positive outcome: flirting in office, repetitiousness, jealousy, handling discussions, gossip, reputation.\nTo start: find any excuse to establish initial rapport. Next time casually mention non-commital coffee place nearby to expand time together. After making sure it can work, start a non-scary offer to do something fun once during non-work hours.

Honestly, the possibility is there.\n\nMasutatsu (Mas) Oyama (1932-1994) had dispayed his incredible punching and striking power upon 52 bulls. Three were killed instantly and 49 had their horns broken off with knife-hand chops. His physical strength and agility could easily silence a tiger in one hit.\n\nIt has been said that if O-Sensei Mas Oyama hit you, YOU BROKE! His nickname was "The Godhand." His martial arts style is known as Kyokushinkai.

The brilliance scale of stars is called magnitudes. It runs backwards (a star of magnitude 1 is brighter than a star of magnitude 3). A difference of 5 on the magnitude scale is a factor of 100x in brightness.\n\nNormally, the faintest stars we can see with the unaided eye is magnitude 6. Some people can see 7 and (in very rare cases) 8. In town, I feel lucky when I can get down to 4.\n\nLet's say that you can see down to magnitude 6 and that your pupil has a diameter of 7 mm (varies with age and other factors).\n\nThen a 70 mm telescope has a diameter 10 times that of your eye's pupil. This means that the area of the telescope's objective lens is 100 times that of your pupil (area varies as the square of the diameter).\n\nThe 70 mm telescope then gathers 100 times more light than your unaided eye (and concentrates it in your eye). Since it makes stars appear 100 times brighter, you should gain 5 steps on the magnitude scale. In theory, if you see down to magnitude 6 with your eyes, you should see stars down to magnitude 11 with the telescope. In practice, other factors limit the gain so maybe you'll get to magnitude 9 or 10.\n\nThe diameter also affects "discrimination": the ability to separate features that are very close. Discrimination varies as the diameter, so the image seen through a 70 mm telescope should be 10 times "crisper" than with the eye only. For example, some stars that appear as single with the eye, could be seen as double in the telescope.
The word paper comes from the ancient Egyptian writing material called "papyrus", which was woven from papyrus plants. \n\nPapyrus was produced as early as 3000 BCE in Egypt, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Further north, parchment or vellum, made of processed sheepskin or calfskin, replaced papyrus, as the papyrus plant requires subtropical conditions to grow. \n\nIn China, documents were ordinarily written on bamboo, making them very heavy and awkward to transport. Silk was sometimes used, but was normally too expensive to consider. Indeed, most of the above materials were rare and costly.\n\nArcheologically, true paper had been excavated in China dated from the 2nd-century BC. It spread slowly outside of China; other East Asian cultures, even after seeing paper, could not figure out how to make it themselves. Instruction in the manufacturing process was required, and the Chinese were reluctant to share their secrets. The technology was first transferred to Korea in 600 and then imported to Japan by a Buddhist priest.\n\nAfter further commercial trading and the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas, the invention spread to the Middle East, where it was adopted in India and subsequently in Italy in about the 13th century. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The oldest known paper document in the West is the Missel of Silos from the 11th century.

The payouts for win, place and show are based on a $2 ticket. For the exotic bets, such as exactas and trifectas, the answer is "it depends." Each exotic listing will usually tell you if the payout is based on a $2 or $1 (or 10c) bet, but it the exotic does not tell you, you can safely assume that it is based on a $2 bet.

The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA or EFAA) was enacted in 1987 by the United States Congress for the purpose of standardizing hold periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate institutions' use of deposit holds. It is also referred to as Regulation CC or Reg CC, after the Federal Reserve regulation that implements the act. The law is codified in Title 12, Chapter 40 of the US Code and Title 12, Part 229 of the Code of Federal Regulations[1].

Yes he can. Actually most of the Argentinians and Brazilian players are either Spaniards or Italians. \n\nAfter working in Europe for a number of years, a player can apply for citizenship. This is something that is very convenient for the club they play for. European regulations set a limit to the number of no-European players a club can hire. \n\nRafa Marquez, like Ronaldo or Roberto Carlos had an Spaniard passport, Spaniard citizenship but they will not play for the Spain´s team. FIFA´s rule comes into play here. One player can only play for one national team, and this is the country of origin, no the country of citizenship. (There is an exception to the rule, if one player had never play with his country of origin, then he can play for the country of adoption)

Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. It is more common during the winter months, and you often develop it after having an upper respiratory tract illness such as influenza (flu) or a cold. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may be a cause, especially in adults older than 65. Acute bronchitis is caused by bacteria about 10% of the time.\n\nAcute bronchitis can also be caused by exposure to smoke, chemicals, or air pollution, all of which can irritate the bronchial tubes, or it can develop from accidentally inhaling (aspirating) food, vomit, or mucous material.

432MHz is extremely slow for running WinXP. You can upgrade, but it sounds like your system is pretty old, and the motherboard is likely imcompatible with some of today's faster CPUs. \n\nThe good news is that you can get a pentium 4 CPU for under $150 and compatible motherboard for well under $100.00. It doesn't make too much sense to have that much memory paired with such a slow CPU.\n\nOn the other hand, you might want to keep in mind that Microsoft is coming out with Windows Vista, their newest operating system, this November.

Direct TV all the way. You have more channel choices and my favorite part is the information display so you actually know what you are watching, what it is about, if it is a repeat, etc. As far as HD if you are a new customer to Direct TV you get a lot of incentives (such as free HD reciever) I just signed up last month and it makes a huge difference. Right now, DirectTv only has a small handful of HD channels, but they have recently installed a new satellite and HD users are supposed to get a largely expanded choice of HD channels in June i think.

A pure democracy is where every person gets a say in how every part of the government is run. Like for instance everyone would come together in a town to vote and decide on what would be best for everybody. It's quite idealistic and can be prone to abuse in this way:\n\nIn a democracy, the ones who are largest and loudest have the most power. Therefore a whole people could be wiped out if the majority said "everyone with brown hair must die." Also as times goes on, the democracy deteriorates into a dictatorship as the most power pursuing persons gain more and more power over the others. A classic example is the deterioration from Lenin's Communism to Stalin's dictatorship later on. It's the closest thing to a pure democracy that has existed as of late.\n\nAs for a Democratic Republic well that's what we have. It's democratic because we vote for whose in office. It's a Republic because it has the legislative, judicial, and executive branch.

Hmm... Money begets money!\n\nIf you already have some money, think about day trading. Some folks equate day-trading with gambling. But if done cautiously (positive cash-flow, decent P/E), then you can safely exploit the (almost) daily waves in the price. These waves have nothing to do with the fundamentals.. It's just herd mentality. You do need 'a lot of patience and fortitude and study', to pick out companies with solid foundations, but which are under-noticed and under-valued. Then you jump in... however, you still got to know when to ride the wave and when to cut losses. One danger is there is not enough material to read on penny companies... that can sometimes surprise you... so beware!\n\nTry some new internet-based pyramid schemes. Again these are often thought to be shady by most. The obviously dangerous schemes to avoid are ponzi, chain letters, money for free etc. But where a 'real' product underlies the pyramid, with (again) positive cash flow, with graded percentage based incentives; it could be a good scheme to generate residual income. Won't see immediate results though. Will take 6-8 months of dedicated time investment..but has a high probability of success.\n\nFinally, nothing beats selling on E-Bay. Make sure you have something unique (though it's not always easy to come up with something unique, given that on an average about 15 million items are on sale on EBay at any given time). But through courteuos, prompt and honest service, you can gradually rake in a good positive response that will raise your profile among sellers and kick in extra business.
Be honest while you are whispering in his/her ear. If you think they have the most awesome eyes, smile, lips. Whatever, just be honest and go into detail on why you like it. Yes, if done right it works.

Sardarji Jokes\n\nSmart Sardarji:\nA Sardarji and an American are seated next to each other on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. The American asks if he would like to play a fun game.\n\nThe Sardarji, tired, just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.\n\nThe American persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He says, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me five dollars, and vice versa."\n\nAgain, he declines and tries to get some sleep.\n\nThe American, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5,and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500."\n\nThis catches the Sardarji's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment, agrees to the game.\n\nThe American asks the first question: "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"\n\nThe Sardarji doesn't say a word, reaches into his wallet,pulls out a $5.00 bill, and hands it to the American.\n\n"Okay," says the American, "your turn".\n\nHe asks, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"\n\nThe American, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer & searches all his preferences........no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the Internet and the Library of Congress... no answer.\n\nFrustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers but to no avail.\n\nAfter an hour, he wakes the Sardarji and hands him $500.\n\nThe Sardarji thanks him and turns back to get some more sleep.\n\nThe American, who is more than a little miffed, stirs the Sardarji and asks, "Well, what's the answer?"\n\nWithout a word, the Sardarji reaches into his purse,hands the american $5,and goes back to sleep.

It depends on what you are putting your faith in. If you are putting your faith in a chair that you know is broken to support you weight and hold you up so you dn't fall, then you may not be right to put your faith in that chair. If you are putting faith in your brakes to stop your car, and you know that your brakes are working great, then you may be right. \n\nDo we only put your faith into things that you know, I think you should always make an effort to put faith in things with consideration of the thing or person you are putting your faith in.\n\nIf we are talking about putting faith in God to save your soul, then it may depend on what god you are talking about. It depends on what god has said regarding faith. If you are hindu, what does god say about faith. If you are Muslim what does it say... and so on... \n\nIf you are going to put faith (hope, trust, love,) into something it shouldn't be done blindly... It should be done with the utmost care and consideration.\nDon't get me wrong there are somethings that can not be tested, tried, etc... so you have to go on your gut feelings, but somethings can be.\n\nI have faith that Jesus died for my sins, and he died and rose aging from the dead.. Is this something I can prove??? I can look at history, and things of that nature, come to a conclusion to support my willingness to put faith in what I am reading in the bible is truth, and this gives me the assurance that putting faith in Jesus is good. I can look at history, the earth, humans... so it really depends on what you are putting your faith in and why.

Christianity is a fulfillment of ones heart and desires, by gambling really you place your greed before your God who is materialistic. materialistic possession we will leave here on earth and when we are judged we will have no worldly things to fall on. Also we will come and go on earth but live for eternity and therefore why don't we live our lives in fulfilling Gods work and then we will be rich in our after lives.

You can build "on top" of GNU software. You just can't include their software in your program. Your software must be separate from theirs. You can link to libraries, access databases, etc but cannot compile their code into yours. If you do, then you should make your code available under the same GNU license.
If you are in the United States, its okay to do this. However, if you go to other countries (especially countries in South America, or to Canada or Mexico) they don't like it when you say that. They say that they are Americans as well because they live in North America. So, if you are in the United States and say it, you should be fine.

if you currently have XP 2800, there are many other CPU's with same price as dual core 805 that can boost your gaming speed.\n\nDon't get confuse about speed and multi-tasking. \n\nFor $100, you can buy a dual-core 805 or a pentium 4 541 3.2GHZ 800MHZ.\n\nThe matter of choice really rely on what you use the system for. Dual-core can handle multitasking extremely well. For instant, it allow you encode a DVD and playing game at the same time. The pentium 541 in the other hand will significantly speed up single task program, like gamming machine. \n\nSo if multi-tasking is not important, consider a single core.\n\ngood luck

The Soviet Army left! Then Austria was able to become a neutral country, but also democratic, free and with a capitalist system (with a strong welfare state). The Soviet Union was a catastrophe for Austria. They killed thousands (including my grandfather's younger brother, who was shot in the head in front of his parents on his 16th birthday), raped thousands of women, burned and destroyed many building and shipped scientists, experts and even factories down to the bricks to the USSR. Political expression was restricted and people were mostly poor. The signing of the State Treaty that declared Austria’s neutrality (and the withdrawal of the USSR Forces) was an event without which Austria could never have become what it is today.\n\nThis is also the period of shared power between the Austrian people's Party (OVP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). They ruled in a coalition almost the entire time (the exception was when one controlled the executive alone, but only for a few years). They used to be enemies and even fought a low-level civil war in the 1920s, but the Nazis treated them both equally terribly, so party leaders realized that the other party wasn't nearly as bad as they thought, and that things could get a lot worse, and were able to cooperate a bit better once they had a chance to regain power.\n\nThis power share ended in 1999 when the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) won 27% of the vote, which put them in second place after the SDP. This obligated the SDP to form a coalition with the FPO and the chain of continuous power sharing between the OVP and SPO was ended. The next elections yielded an OVP-FPO coalition, although since then the FPO has lost a lot of popularity and did poorly in regional local elections getting a fraction over 10% of the vote), followed by a defection of many FPO leaders to form a new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), so it is likely that the SDP and OVP coalition could be back on during the next national elections. \n\nPeople made a big fuss over the FPO making it into the coalition, but I always thought that they were a bit stupid, as the FPO had won 22% of the vote during the previous parliamentary elections, which was not enough to get them in the coalition but still pretty close, so the fact that they managed to pick up five more points wasn’t exactly the political shock many outside of Austria liked to pretend it was. I really don’t like the FPO and I’ll be glad to see them go, but they aren’t Nazis. They are just a very conservative European party, and the other countries lead by other European parties threatened by similar parties in their own countries took the opportunity to denounce the FPO in an effort to similarly denounce their own rivals.

media is business above everything else. one should understand this before blindly taking in everything that is put forth. Most media organizations have inclinations towards certain political parties and corporate clients. While it is important to keep up ethics, it isnt always easy to do so. the media industry , just like any other industry is pressurised for various issues by various sources. For example , a newspaper might receive huge ad revenue from say a car manufacturer. If that car company launches a new product, the newspaper will be pressurised to cover the event and give it a positive slant though that is not exactly what the newspaper's editorial team would want to do if they werent pressurised into doing so by marketing and sales department. Likewise, a channel which receives majority of its funding from a political party , either directly of indirectly, would put forth stories only in favor of that particular party. Though the stories might appear not appear to be taking stands, subtly and subconsciously , the language used in the script would very discreetly influence the audience and fashion a change in the attitude of the end viewer. This is how we develop certain views about certain issues. This not only applies to an individual but also to the society at large. Continuous exposure to similar content that puts forth sterotypical views about certain issues cause the end receiver to develop the same views as most forms of media are assertive and suggestive rather than interactive. \n\nSo, the question whether the media is biased is a very broad. It is a business at the end of the day and it is how you look at it and how you take it. If you can read between lines and assess what is shown on screen, it isnt biased. But if you cant to do it, yes it is biased. I would say, the media business is a pure play of human psychology. While there isnt anything that is false that is being put forth , one should understand that it isnt entirely true either. So, it all depends on how you look at it and whether you allow the businessmen to play with your weakenesses.
If you get a flu shot, you are getting viral particles that have been raised in chicken eggs and inactivated by treatment with formalin.\n\nIf you got the flu mist thing, you get a weakened virus of some sort.\n\nAnyhow, you can feel like garbage after getting the shot because you are experiencing an immune reaction to what was injected (that's the point!), as your body recognizes that something is there that shouldn't be. You don't get the flu because the viral particles are unable to do anything because the of the formalin treatment. This year my arm hurt for an hour or so, but that was all.

Probably not. Unlike Iraq, Iran has a respectable military and I doubt many people would welcome American forces (as happened at first in Iraq). Such a war would be long and bloody, with no clear winner. The U.S. would have the advantage of training, equipment, and the general qualities of troops, but Iran can field a much larger army and the citizens themselves would probably take up arms in large numbers (whereas in Iraq the numbers are comparably small).\n\nTo have a chance, America would need to pirate the media airways in Iran and broadcast the truth, as opposed to Iranian propaganda, for several years before the population itself would even be manageable.\n\nWhat, then, would be the goal of a U.S. attack against Iran? The best that could be hoped for is an eventual truce where Iran is a little more reasonable than it has been.

If I understand your question correctly, you might be looking at it in the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, many of the most prestigious universities are in English-speaking countries. So you need to know English to be able to attend those schools.\n\nAlso, as mentioned, many of today's academic documents are printed in English, so you have to know English to have access to them.\n\nFinally, English is a very important language in the world today, so knowing English will help you to get the best jobs after you graduate.

Here's the million dollar question -- had he told you, would you have spent the money on the appeal? \n\nHere's the next million dollar question -- had you appealled, what were your chances of winning? \n\nThese are two of about a thousand questions that will come up in a legal malpractice claim. A legal mal suit is very, very difficult and unless you have a lot of money lying around, you probably can't afford to file one.\n\nThat having been said, go talk to a legal mal attorney right now. Only a competent legal malpractice lawyer in your area, having a greater knowledge of the facts, will be able to advise you of your rights and your chances of success.\n\nOnce you've done that, make sure and report your former attorney to the state bar. Yes, he screwed up. He most certainly should have advised you of the time to appeal and left the decision up to you as to whether to appeal. He should be disciplined for this. He potentially screwed up very badly.

Bring it up to them, and ask them why exactly are they doing that to you? If they are not understanding what you are talking about. Then explain to them what your feelings are, and tell them if they keep doing it, that your going to stop hanging out with them. If you have already told them your feelings, then stop hanging out with them and let them see that your serious about your feelings. A true friend is not going to do that kind of stuff anyways.

Most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things - getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program (also known as MLM or pyramid plans) OR they have their own business. Your own business is something you create yourself, not find on the internet. You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless "opportunities" out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?

years ago the answer to that might have been no, but in today's world it's almost impossible to find anybody that doesn't have a kid...male or female...i'm sure that there may be some foolish ones out there that might have something stupid to say, but the truth is most of us don't care if you have kids...the one thing that we do look at though is how close you are to your baby's daddy...because we all know that they like to role through from time to time just to get a little bit...as long as you have him under control you should have no problem finding someone to share your life with...
I think that he is torn between 2 different women and he had to decide to choose--- unfortunately he did not choose you. The other women is probably controlling and has talked him into getting married. I would say he does not want to talk to you any more b/c of the simple fact that he is ashamed, doesn't want to hurt you anymore and because he probably b/c he also doesn't want to hurt this other girl. Just give it sometime and see what pans out more than likely if there wedding is a ways off she will probably leave him like she did before... at that point in time if he truly loved you he will come back to you b/c he will have realized what he lost. I would say even though he is saying hurtful and mean things more than likely he isn't mad at you and is only doing what he is doing b/c he is ashamed of what he did or the crazy other women could have his cell phone and is texting it without his knowledge. Anyways good luck and if you do happen to find another great guy in the mean time at least give them a chance maybe all of this just happened for a reason.

Well, I'll certainly try. I like the cat ears, by the way.\n\nFirst, you'll need to find a program to publish the e-flyer in. This can be MS Word, Publisher, or Quark. I actually would recommend doing something like this in Fireworks or Photoshop, but if you don't have the budget for those higher end products, I wouldn't worry too much.. For now, I'll go with Word since everyone has that.\n\nI'm not sure what your making your e-flyer for, so that's pretty much your part. Set up it up however you'd like with pictures, your bio, your service list, contact info, etc. Whatever you'd like. The trick will be getting people to see the e-flyer. I would go about it two ways. Create a .pdf file, and publish it to a web site and distribute the web address to potential clients (if you're a service based business). To create a pdf, I'd download a program called CutePDF.\nhttp://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp\nIt'll allow you to save it as a small file format, and most users wont be able to edit it. You can also save your file in Word as an HTML document that is automatically ready to be uploaded to a server on the web. If you don't have a domain name, I beleive you can get free ones at places like Yahoo! or GeoCities (like me.yahoohomepage.com, etc.).\n\nOne other thing, when you're done, I'd screen capture the .pdf (by pressing the PRTSC button on the top right hand part of the keyboard), import the picture into Paint and edit out your desktop, and save the file as a .jpg file that you can insert into emails and send out. Hope at least some of this helps, feel free to contact me if you need help or have more questions. Good luck!

I don't know about the Palm Life Drive PDA, but my dad has another PDA which he configured to the BSNL thing. You have to go to the network settings and set IP address, default gateway etc as provided by BSNL. Also there is a setting(not sure in yours) that you have to change from 'work' to 'internet'. Then if the modem is on(with the wireless light on) and the wifi on your pda is switched on, it should work.

Define a loner and In what context? \n\nPlease keep in mind my answers are from lifes experience, I am not a Trained mental health professsional I am just an earthy, sincere mature person who is willing to share my knowledge.\n\nIn youth (say between kindergarten and grade six) being a 'LONER' might be brought on by a home environment where reserve is the norm. Sometime it is a sign of high intelligence in a child, he/she may feel bored or not interested because they are different in intelect to their peers. Then again maybe he/she my just be new in the neighborhood. On the dark side Being a loner has been shown quite often to be an early sign of mental illness or worst yet, physical or emotional child abuse. The reasons can be many and just as varied.\n\nIn the more formative years say 7th grade to 12th grade the hormones are raging all around him/her and all the same reasons above apply plus some new ones such as \n(1.) Religeous upbringing. (2.) Fear of contageous deseases. (3.) Acne. (4.) Lack of self esteem. (5.) Being Bullied, Not accepted by peers. (6) Serious problems at home. These are the years where you are force by life experiences to 'MATURE'. Choices have to be made and quickly, many and heady desisions have to be made (college or not, sex or not, are two examples), this requires 'MORE SPACE' to ebolve and react positively in emotions and actions. In the mature years college and thereafter all these 'factoids' still play an important role in human relations and even more 'factoids' come to light. An example might be a difference in lifes goals or direction of careers.\n \nThe list can go on and on. And to put it bluntly to you specifcally. This is good time for many commitments. But maybe not a very good time for ROMANTIC/EMMOTIONAL COMMITMENTS.
Do any of you even know what remote viewing is? It's the process of seeing at a distance.

It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool. We all do it. You should try sleeping in a different position. It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder. It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist. If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.

The term "heavy metal" can be a bit confusing because the meaning has changed over time and means different things to different people.\n\nOriginally, all metal up until about the mid 1980's was just called heavy metal. This included Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and some of the hard rock bands that influenced them like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nTo metalheads, heavy metal is a term that differentiates that certain type of metal from thrash metal, death metal, etc. Main characteristics of the heavy metal sub-genre are two-guitar harmonies, aggressive riffs, and powerful clean vocals with a lot of emphasis on the upper ranges. \n\nIt's really hard to classify the metal sub-genres because there is a lot of similarities and crossovers between the genres. You'd really have to listen to a lot of metal to truly understand all of the distinct characteristics of each one.
People need to vote in every election. That way you can get people in that aren't controlled by the party. If you vote along party lines that's all you get. If only 40% of people vote, that means that 60% of the people don't even care who gets elected. How can you have a government that cares about the people if they know they won't vote anyway? The rich corporations will pay them millions to push through their agendas.
The use of Zonegran (zonisamide) by pregnant women hasn't been fully studied, but there are serious concerns based on studies using animals. When it was given to pregnant mice, rats, and dogs early in pregnancy, there were high rates of fetal abnormalities, especially heart defects and skeletal malformations. After it was given to monkeys during certain stages of pregnancy, many of the fetuses died, possibly because of malformations. All of these effects occurred at doses (and blood levels in the mother) that were equivalent to the amounts used to treat epilepsy in humans, or sometimes even lower. There was also a higher rate of death among the offspring of rats who were given zonisamide late in their pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled Zonegran as "Pregnancy Category C" and recommends that women who could possibly become pregnant should use effective birth control while using Zonegran. Recognizing that seizures in the mother also may be hazardous to a fetus, however, they conclude that the risks and benefits must be weighed in considering the use of Zonegran during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant.

OK-I asked a few rabbis, and people from my community, to see what they think (I couldn't quite remember what I saw before...), and so far, I had answers saying that they did not think there was one specific simply (i.e. a Jewish star, a cross, etc.). I'll contact you ASAP to let you know if I've found something.
I remember that the auto Xfmr (buck/boost) has standard input terminals then a series of terminals based on the voltage range you are looking for. Look at the connection diagram shown on the link below.\n\nYou want to have the Xfmr setup to Figure C where you have input on H4 and X1/X3. The Xfmr is jumpered between H3 to H2 and H1 to X4/X2. The Output comes off of H4 and H1. H4 terminal would be considered common. Monitor the output voltage using a trusty DVM, don't ever go by the info on the Xfmr.
Start with a book on electricity and magnetism. Yes, that is the most common way of generating electromagnetic waves. It is practical from microwave frequencies nearly all the way down to zero in frequency.
When it no longer meets the original reasons you invested in the first place.\n\nWhen it exceeds your "asset allocation" in its class. Consider (if that's the case) selling 25%, 50% etc of your total holdings.\n\nThe key to successful investing is having and maintaining a good "asset allocation". This is more important than getting the right stock or mutual fund.

Love isnt always on time.
I'd say that's a clear cut case of a girl hanging with a guy after a few drinks he asks if he could kiss her she says no but gives in and they kiss anyways, but then they see eachother again sober, he is all nice and holds hands, hugs her blah blah but no kiss...when saying bye she is ready to walk away but he reaches out for a hug she hugs, he hugs tight and kisses her on the lips but a regular kiss with closed lips so she does the same.\n\nSorry. I couldn't resist. BUT seriously, Sasha, it sounds like chemistry. I hope by saying no you meant yes and not no, thus becoming NOT a doormat. Sounds like good clean fun, really it does. Be safe. Peace.
yes for sure

Art bell is no one...\nWho told you he exist?\nDude how can a person who does not exist have a brain?\n\n\nI hate art bell you know why... Bcoz of his HATE LETTER TO THE FILIPINOS... Here read...\n\n-------------------------\n\nFilipinos.....*make me puke* (Art Bell)\n\nAs we've all come to notice, in the past few decades, Filipinos have begun to infest the United States like some sort of disease. Their extensive involvement in the U.S. Armed Forces is proof of the trashy kind of qualities all filipinos tend to exhibit on a regular basis. You can see this clearly by studying the attitudes and cultural Icons of most Filipino Americans.\n\nOrigins of Pinoys/Pinays: \n\nAre they really asian? Well we've come to accept the fact the filipinos come from a part of the world known as South East Asia. But the term "Asia" is used in the wrong way. You may notice that contemporary Filipino Americans try very hard to associate themselves with groups that we know as Asian. I cannot count the number of times I have seen a 'Third World' Filipino try to connect themselves to the chinese or Japanese people. There is no connection and here's why. The Philippines is a Third World country. Nothing respectable has EVER been created by Filipino people during our entire human history. Young filipino men in America have become obsessed with "import racing". They have an enormously perverted affection for Japanese cars. It's a common phenomenon. In their minds, these Filipinos somehow believe that they are asian and that it somehow connects them to Japanese people and japanese cars. They often take credit for the ingenuity of Japanese people and say how it's an "Asian thing". This term..."Asian thing" derived directly from African American slang "black thang". "It's a black thang." "It's an asian thang." \n\nYou can see the connection. It's even funnier that, in Japan, Filipinos are heavily discriminated against. The only filipinos that can live successfully in Japan are the filipino prostitutes. But that's the case for most Filipino people no matter where they live in th e world. Now we've come down to this fact...and it is a fact. \n\nNothing in Filipino Culture can be seen as Asian.\n\nThey have no architectural, artistic, or cultural influence which is in ANY way, asian. Thinking of the great countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and China there is no way you can possibly connect the Philippine Islands. This assault by filipino americans to connect themselves with the great peoples of North East Asia is foul and disgusting. Try visiting a young filipino's web site too. \n\nYou'll see something called the "Asian IRC Ring". It has to do with the chatrooms. The most horrible thing about this is that these TRASHY people are trying to associate themselves with Asia again!! People in Asia don't act like this at all. What we are seeing here is the natural Filipino in its element with full access to technology and this is how they act! You will consistently see this behavior over and over again. \n\nAnother interest ing thing is that these "thirdworld" people also frequent RC chatrooms such as #chinese #japan and #asian. They must believe that they are somehow related racially or culturally to North Asians. But it's completely WRONG! There might have been some distant contact With China and even less with Japan during World War II, but these people are actually more closely related to african americans and Mexican americans. \n\nDo the parents of these young filipinos know what's going on? Would they accept this? I believe that they would and do. This is the natural "Trash" element in filipinos manifesting itself. Nothing good has ever come from Philippines and I don't believe anything good ever will. \n\nRecognizing your Roots (A Message to Filipinos). To all filipino people: \nPleas

Lytle and GSP. GSP is a different fighter and a better one now. He was scared and intimidated when he first fought Hughes and wouldn't even look him in the face when McCarthy was talking to them. Now he is stronger has the best stamina and all around better than Matt Hughes. Hughes is a good fighter but he got lucky with that arm bar against him, and he is wrestler and that's all. he is not a stand up person. GSP can knock him out. Hughes doesn't have knock out power. I think GSP will win in the second round.
Only these two things have to happen for your question to be deleted:\n\n1. Some immature crybaby who is easily offended reports you \n2. The Y!A staff feel sorry for the little jerk and away goes your question or answer.
Here is a direct answer. From a Republican that can truthfully say she was a Democrat for over 20 years . \n\nHelping the needy --- I do it all the time and don't parade my politics or say look what I'm doing for them.\nBeing taxed -- it sucks , I don't make 35thou a year but I am doubled taxed for being self-employed.\nAbortion - don't care for it as a means of birth control otherwise it is a private matter. \nImmigration is a great thing it made this country diverse \nIllegal immigration is wrong - get in line like a law biding person and wait your turn. \nAffirmative action - hard to say, I was a woman in a man's Navy and other than resentment it never helped. Everyone is equal to me . \nMiddle Easterners- have many friends of various decent and yes some are from the Middle East. \nAtheist & non-christians- Not my place to judge. My one grandmother is an atheist and my husband is angnostic and I have my Muslim friends others I don't ask their religion as that isn't my business. \n\nSo sorry but none of that pisses me off. People who try to sterotype and put barriers between people do .
Life originated on Earth - as far as archeologists have figured - by RNA. RNA are a bunch of proteins that line up, and once lined up they perform a function - copy/paste. They split and create identicle RNA. RNA later evolved to DNA - DNA is the double helix, where RNA was a single helix. DNA was smarter and controlled RNA production. RNA is like a blueprint. RNA is believed to have formed in one of two ways. \nOne leading theory believes that microscopic cracks in clay got packed with protein strands, and after a few million years a few of them lined up right and turned into RNA. \nAnother theory that is gaining more credibility with time states that in deep oceans, underwater volcanic vents created high pressure and high energy, and there was a lot of smashing about of proteins down there, and eventually they randomly aligned - again we're talking like millions of years of chance smashings before a few were lined up in a pattern that would survive.\nFrom there, RNA smashed into eachother similarly to the protein strands until two perfectly lined up, and bam: DNA. (Again a few million years time probably went by)\nThis continued, and soon DNA evolved with cell walls into Bacteria, and bacteria absorbed different sorts of RNA and smaller, weaker bacteria, and they used these smaller species as tools to become a stronger whole being, and soon they had absorbed a few different things, formed a strong outer wall, and became cells. \nNeat, huh?

basing your opinion of someone only on their looks is sometimes called a "first impression". Sometimes that the only thing you have to go on.\n\nBut as you get to know someones personality that first impression usually changes.

A defibrillator is a medical device used in the defibrillation of the heart. It consists of a central unit and a set of two electrodes. The central unit provides a source of power and control. The two electrodes are placed directly on or in the patient. The device is designed to deliver an electric shock to the patient, in an effort to stop ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac condition that consists of a lack of coordination of the contraction of the muscle tissue of the large chambers of the heart that eventually leads to the heart stopping altogether.\n\nAs you can see the defibrillator doesn't actually start a stopped heart, it only corrects the poor pumping action of the heart.

You're friend can not take the fifth unless she somehow incriminates herself by testifying. For example, there are two business CEO. CEO 1 is on trial. CEO 2 would take the fifth testifying in CEO 1's trial if he's testimony would incriminate himself.\n\nSince she is the victim of on assult I would say taking the fifth is not a logical choice.\n\nIt depends on the case as far as if she has to testify or not. The judge can make her come to court and testify by issuing a subpoena (which should be delivered by mail and/or a cop knocking on the door). If she chooses NOT to go to court even though a subpoena was issued she can be in BIG trouble and action can be taken against her. \n\nIf she doesn't want to testify she should go to the court house (as soon as possible) and get information from the District Attorney, Clerk of Court and/or the prosecuting attorney in determining whether she has to testify or not.
Yes.. It should be illegal, but as long as there are people willing to pay the high prices they'll stay in business.. It's a total screw job.. \n\nGoing to one of those place is about as smart as going to one of those CHECK CASHING places or a PAY DAY LOAN place.. Where you get the money now then they cash your check after you get paid.. RIP OFF
It depends upon how the patch is attached. \n\nIf it is sewed on, get a stitch cutter and it is real easy to remove. Its a small tool designed to safely and easily cut stitches without damaging the material.\n\nIf it is an iron-on patch, although you can get it off, some of the glue will often remain on the cloth and discolor it. You must have an iron, and either the protective paper used to put the patch on or a crisp, clean cloth. \n\nI have found that wetting the cloth beneath the patch helps. Put the cloth or protective paper over the patch and heat it until it is loose and use some clamping scissors or tweezers to peel the patch off. You must quickly scrape off the glue using a clean, flat-bladed tool like a putty knife or a butter knife.\n\nGood luck, it's not an easy procedure.

First, take inventory of what you have and figure out what people ARE buying from you now. Then increase your offerings in those areas and get rid of things that don't sell. If people don't have a lot of money they will still need to buy essential items like food, toilet paper, paper towels, deodorants, toothpaste.... Try and give them options that will allow them the "convenience" of picking up their medicines AND other items they will need. I hope this helps!

You need a lot of information. I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business: Real Life Start-Up Advice from 101 Successful Entrepreneurs http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101129/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- If You're Clueless About Starting Your Own Business and Want to Know More http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574100939/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- Start Your Own Business : The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Need http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891984217/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- Steps to Small Business Start-Up : Everything You Need to Know to Turn Your Idea into a Successful Business http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101323/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor the licenses you need to your store, go to your Secretary of State website and look for information on how to start a business. That will contain the info you need and contact information\n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."
Even if the business owner has a license to operate, that does not mean that the owner has gotten a zoning approval to run his business from home and park his limos on the street.\n\nZoning board typically takes a blind eye on home businesses -- UNTIL a neighbor complains. When a resident in the neighborhood complains of the traffic, inconveniences, too much comings-and-goings of vehicle in a RESIDENTIAL neighborhood, the business owner will be asked (and in many cases, sued) by the county to stop operating the business in the community.\n\nI suggest you go to your county office zoning board. Check how your area is zoned, and if it is residential, then ask the procedure for filing a complaint. If the City/county officials find the business owner to be in violation of subdivision ordinances covering the amount of space required, and neighbors have complained about parking and traffic problems - they can close the business.\n\nNeighbors' complaints are always the litmus test in zoning. You can make it really difficult for them to operate their business, and I think you've got a good basis with their type of business. \n\nHence, it is strongly recommended that home business entrepeneurs first check the zoning laws in the area to determine if the business is compliant. And be very nice to the neighbors! Otherwise, you can see your entire business hampered, if not closed, if zoning regulators get to you.

The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate produced in the glycolysis is first decarboxylated to yield acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to yield citrate. Citrate is then converted to isocitrate. Isocitrate is then converted to a-ketoglutarate (first CO2 is lost and the first NADH is produced). A-keto is converted to succinyl-CoA (CO2 produced). At this point the rest of the cycle is to regenerate oxaloacetate. The succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate (producing GTP) which is converted to fumarate (produces FADH2). Fumarate is converted to Malate and finally to Oxaloacetate (NADH produced). Krebs cycle produces a total of 1 GTP, 1 FADH2 and 3 NADH. The FADH2 and NADH enter the electron transport chain. For each molecule of glucose there will be 2 turns of the cycle.

If you are talking cancer with brain mets, this means that the cancer has spread to the brain area. It may or may not hurt depending on the symptoms or where the cancer is first located in the body. If there are tumors in the brain you may experience some headaches, vision changes, dizziness or balance problems, or neurological changes with numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or limbs of the body. It may have paralyzing limb changes, speech changes, memory changes, and stroke like symptoms as well. This also depends on the staging of the cancer that the doctor decides with further testing, such as CT scans, MRI's and blood tests. The mets ususally means metastasized, that it is more advanced and has originated in a different spot in the body to begin with.

As soon as we let them.\n\nWinston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

Well why would they become legal and have to pay taxes? Why embrace our culture, hell why appreciate anything our country has to offer? We only pay their medical, school lunches, rent, food, bills, we give them more rights and opportunities than we have ourselves. What incentive do we give them to become legal? I guess besides being the right thing to do there's just not much appeal. Why make something of yourself when you can sit on your couch and eat other people tax dollars all day? Why have a career and follow laws when you can have 8 babies, with all-expenses-paid vacations in our hospitals, and have our government pay to raise them too? And once they're all grown, you can teach them to wave the Mexican flag and spit on the American culture that paid for everything they've ever eaten or owned, and if you've had the decency to learn English then you can insult every American you run across and make sure that they know that "L.A." is now Mexico. Oh yeah, make sure you and your 8 kids burn and tear down lots of America's flags and put your up, and be as ungrateful as you can.\n\nIt makes me sick.\n\nPlease go here http://www.getmycountryback.com and help me do something about it.

Silver Lake Camp Preserve\n\nThe Silver Lake Camp Preserve encompasses a bog, swamp and northern hardwood forest upland. The bog and swamp can be explored from a one-half mile, handicap-accessible boardwalk. Along the way there are 15 interpretive stations that key in with a brochure that can be picked up at the sign-in box.\n\nThe spruce-tamarack bog section is acidic and holds sphagnum moss and carnivorous pitcher plants; the cedar swamp contains lots of ferns. Unlike marshes, bogs provide limited opportunities for plants and wildlife. Among the bird species present in the wetlands are Olive-Sided Flycatchers, Hermit Thrushes and Maryland Warblers.\n\nA good insect repellant or head net, especially at this time of year, will add to your comfort while walking above the wetlands.\n\nThe upland section is characterized by northern hardwoods and hemlocks and includes a view of Silver Lake from a ridge. There are a couple of miles of trails in the Preserve, 61 total acres owned by the Nature Conservancy.\n\nTo get there from AuSable Forks, take the Silver Lake Road to the "Y" at Silver Lake. Turn left and drive about a mile to the Old Hawkeye Road. Take a left; the Preserve sign is on the right a short way down the road. From Route 3 in Clayburg, take the Silver Lake Road to the "Y" and turn right, then proceed as above.

You can join shadow shopper for a 5 buck trial for 30 days. IF you find lots of jobs, then u can sign on for the $60 membership. I tried it just because it was $5 and actually made $120.00 on my first job, which was at 6 or 7 different sites for the same company so it was all on one check and this place paid quickly. Well, i joined in feb so i missed canceling my membership by 1 day so had to pay the $60 but made about $500 last year mystery shopping, so i guess it was worth it. Plus you can write it off as a work expense on your taxes.
Democracy is a government run by the people. Democracy alone doesn't necessarily provide freedom. After all, the PEOPLE might not want everyone to have freedom. \n\nAs for starving people, that's not really a democracy thing. You're now thinking more along the lines of socialism or communism which is more concerned with even distribution of resources. \n\nbtw, the United States isn't a democracy, it's a republic.

generally, if a primary tooth exfoliates on its own (falls out) you will not see a root. the adult tooth pushes on the baby root, resorbing it, therefore allowing it to fall out. if a baby tooth is extracted, for whatever reason, you will often times be able to see the root (if it has not already been resorbed)\n\nso to answer your question: primary teeth have roots, but when it falls out, the root will no longer be there
Workers' compensation laws are created entirely by the legislature, so what benefits you are entitled to receive depend on the laws in your state. Workers' Comp is supposed to be a compromise that allows employers to have some limit on liability in exchange for worker protections in case of work injuries. For example, if there were no workers' comp laws, an employer could simply avoid liability for work injuries by going out of business and leave the worker holding the bag for medical bills and lost wages. In exchange for this protection for workers most states do not allow workers to sue the employer, other than for workers' comp benefits, except in very limited circumstances. (like intentional injuries or violations of certain safety requirements) The law usually does provides for some type of award of compensation for permanent impairment. In Ohio, it's called a permanent partial disability award. That gives you some award of compensation to account for permanent residuals of the allowed conditions in your claim. There are also additional awards if you lose the use of a bodypart, such as an arm, leg or finger. Unfortunately, there is no specific award for pain and suffering. Good luck and best wishes for a full recovery.

(1) False Start - the most common. Too many of these are called. I wish they would change it where it is a penalty ONLY if the person is crossed the line AFTER the ball is hiked\n(2) Offsides - this used to be the most common, but has been overshadowed by False Start. \n(3) Holding - whether offense or defense. I'd like to see this change, too. Considering how violent football is, 'holding' is almost funny\n(4) Pass Interference - The harshest of all penalties. I think they do a pretty good job calling this (you must go after the ball, not the receiver) but having a hand on the receiver should NOT be called Pass Interference\n(5) Neutral Zone Infraction - After all the years I've followed football, I cannot adequately explain this. They treat it like NBA basketball, where you cannot just 'wander' into a particular area before the ball is hiked by the other team. Dumb dumb penalty
Frankly if I owned the Cubs I would cut the cord with both of them. Whoever were their pitching coaches through the years should have been fired on the spot. Neither one of them were ever taught proper pitching mechanics. The result has been obvious. It's too late in the game to change either one of them. Best case scenario would be to make the stronger of the two a middle relief pitcher and the other a one or two inning closer. I would never start either one of them again.

When you say "in process" does that mean an offer has been submitted and you have not received an answer? If that is the case then I would suspect that this is a mistake on the part of the IRS. If you have submitted an offer, you should already have a contact there that you are dealing with: that is where to start. If you get now satisfaction from that route, get on-line at www.irs.gov and find the telephone number for your local Taxpayer Advocate.

It is a long way from Star Trek, but teleportation - the disembodiment of an object in one location and its reconstruction in another - has been successfully carried out in a physics lab in Australia. \nScientists at the Australian National University (ANU) made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away. \n\nWhen physicists teleported photons for the first time in 1997 they had to destroy the photons to be sure that the teleportation had been successful. Now a team at the University of Vienna has managed to teleport photons without destroying them. Jian-Wei Pan and colleagues believe that their method could be the next step towards long-distance quantum communication (J-W Pan et al. 2003 Nature 421 721).\n\nIn quantum teleportation the sender, normally called Alice, instantaneously transfers the quantum state of a particle to a receiver, called Bob. In most experiments so far Alice has teleported the quantum state of a photon - defined in terms of its polarization - to Bob. The photon itself is not transferred: rather Bob’s photon acquires exactly the same polarization as Alice’s. The uncertainty principle means that Alice cannot know the exact state of her photon, but another feature of quantum mechanics called “entanglement” means that this is not an obstacle to teleporting the state to Bob. \n\nQuantum entanglement essentially allows two particles to behave as one, regardless of how far apart they are. Photons can be entangled so that if one is vertically polarized, for instance, then the other photon in the pair is always horizontally polarized. \n\nIn a standard teleportation experiment a laser is directed at a crystal with nonlinear optical properties. Occasionally the photon will be “down-converted” into two lower energy photons, and sometimes these photons will have their polarizations entangled. In a teleportation experiment the beam is reflected back through the crystal to sometimes produce a second pair of entangled photons. By convention the photons in the first pair are labelled 2 and 3 (for mode 2 and mode 3), and those in the second pair are 1 and 4. Photons 1 and 2 are directed to Alice, photon 3 is sent to Bob and photon 4 is used as a trigger. A variety of mirrors, beamsplitters and polarizers are used to direct the photons to four detectors labelled D1, D2, D3 and T (for trigger). \n\nThe aim of the experiment is to transfer, or teleport, the polarization of photon 1 to photon 3. This is normally done by making a joint measurement on photons 1 and 2 which changes the polarization of the latter in such a way that photon 3 - which is entangled with it - always acquires the same polarization as the first photon. In other words the quantum state of photon 1 - which was unknown to Alice - has been teleported to photon 3. \n\nThe experiment was set up such that detectors D1, D2 and T all register photons at the same time when teleportation takes place. However, under certain circumstances - the emission of two photons each into modes 1 and 4 - it is possible for the same three detectors to register events even though there is no photon in mode 3 to teleport to. These spurious events mean that the D3 detector must also register - and destroy - a photon to be sure that teleportation has taken place. \n\nBy using a filter to reduce the intensity of the photons that are going to be teleported the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of spurious detection events. The Vienna team could be 97% certain that the state had been teleported to photon 3 without actually having to detect it. Such a high accuracy means that the teleported photons could be used in “quantum repeaters” for long distance communication. The team now hopes to combine these results with a technique known as “entanglement purification” to further develop quantum communication over long distances.\n\n\n\nThe achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible, at

the way I see it there are 4 kinds of teachers. The 2 good kind, or at least have good intentions are 1. teachers who are strict because they care about their students and want them to make something of themselves. 2. Teachers who are leniant on students because they know they're just fooling around or don't want to crush their spirit; and then the not-so-good kind, #3. The kind of teacher who is strict because they just dislike the student or the class in general and #4. the teacher who is very leniant because they really just don't care. I've had all 4 kinds throughout my life. you cant tell the difference between numbers 1 and 3 because #1 will usually seem to genuinly care about their students and will try to organize exciting things or make classes more interesting. and the difference between #2 and 4 is that number 2 wants to be the nice teacher, and show the students that they care through that. #4 Just kind of sits at their desk and plays solitaire.

A CT examination with an effective dose of 10 millisieverts (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x rays.) may be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer of approximately 1 chance in 2000. This increase in the possibility of a fatal cancer from radiation can be compared to the natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S. population, about 1 chance in 5. In other words, for any one person the risk of radiation-induced cancer is much smaller than the natural risk of cancer. Nevertheless, this small increase in radiation-associated cancer risk for an individual can become a public health concern if large numbers of the population undergo increased numbers of CT screening procedures of uncertain benefit. \nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ct/risks.html

The 'condoms' you are referring to are known as dental dams and they are not to be used for sexual or anal intercourse. They are designed strictly for oral sex.\n\nI haven't seen the mini-condom kind around for ages so cannot suggest a source. But you could always just use a regular condom and unroll it to just cover the head leaving the rest trapped below the bottom of the head. Just remember that STI's can be present along the shaft so it might be wiser to cover it all.\n\nAs for oral sex on a female vagina or anyone's anal area, there are a variety of sites that describe dental dam use and how to obtain or make them. A couple are below.

Carey, I'm sorry but the weight loss goal you are pursuing is nor realistic or safe. And I would not even consider losing that kind of weight in that short a time period without medical guidance.\n\nEven at your level of obesity, the most amount of weight you should consider losing on any given week should not exceed 3-5 pounds. This would not even get you half way to your goal, but at least you would have a much better chance of permanent weight loss.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to seek the advice and guidence of a naturopathic doctor who can help guide you in the right direction for safe and permanent weight loss through diet, supplementation and even exercise.\n\nIn the meantime here are some helpful tips for you to review:\n\nLose Weight Safely:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/losesafely.html\n\nHealthy Eating\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/healthyeating.html\n\nWeight Management Issues\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/management.html

Ouch... if I were you I would definitely ask about it... just kind of lean ito it with questions like, "why were you outside talking on the phone?" "who were you talking to earlier?" Or go straight out and ask him who he is going to lunch with next saturday and when he is at lunch give him a small phone call. You have every right to be concerned I know I would be. Normally when a girl becomes suspicious of her boyfriend she is usually about 60-80% right about what's going on so definitely ask him about it before you drive yourself crazy. Leave him if he is keeping into too much touch with his ex. It'll become a lot of trouble in the end. Good Luck.

Mild central canal stenosis means there is mild narrowing of the central canal of one or more vertebra(e). The central canal contains the spinal cord down to about the 1st/2nd lumbar vertebrae.

It is much more important to understand WHAT is causing the narrowing and, if possible, WHY the cause is present.

The largest erect member in medical literature would be the 14-inch organ mentioned by Dr. David Reuben in his book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1969). Reuben didn’t divulge any source for this figure, and there was no independent verification, so you may question his accuracy. The largest medically verified penis on record is 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches around, documented in the early twentieth century by Dr. Robert L. Dickinson. Other sources (Alfred Kinsey, Masters and Johnson, etc.) mention specimens ranging from 9.5 to 12 inches.\n\nThen there are the dubious claims of immense penis size by various personages operating within the sex industry (read: porn actors). These claims are almost invariably false, the result of exaggeration and hype by unscrupulous dealers hoping to hawk more products. Take the legendary Long Dong Silver, for instance. Made famous by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, his one enduring trait was his supposedly 18-inch penis. Totally fraudulent, as it turns out; in fact, there are videos in which he appears only normal sized.

The solar wind is a continuous stream of ions (electrically charged particles) that are given off by the sun. Since the particles are emitted from the Sun as the Sun rotates, the solar wind blows in a pinwheel pattern through the solar system. It takes the solar wind about 5 days to reach Earth; it has a velocity of about 500 miles/hour (800 km/sec). The solar wind travels along vibrating magnetic waves which are propagated by the Sun

you are trying to find the probability that democrats win, and the bill passes. Let A be the event that the demos win, and B be the event that the bill passes. Also recognize that this is a conditional probability question.\nWe know the following info: \nP(A) = .6 "democrats have a 60 %"\nP(B|A) = .9 "90 % chance of passing if the Democrats win "\nP(A and B) "what the question wants you to find"\nthe conditional prob formula says that \n\nP(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A) = .9 x .6 = .54\n\nSo there is a 54% of both things happening

Get of your self rightous high horse and stop to realize that in order to learn, one must ask questions. You were not born educated in the word of God. You I'm sure asked many questions when you were wanting to learn about God. Where did you misplace your humility.\n\nIt's an attitude like yours that runs off the lost soul who is seeking out God's truth, and their salvaion through His truth. If they percieve all Chrsitians to spout off like you just did, they would not want to become a Chrisitan for fear of becoming like someone like you. And who could blame them?\n\nYou not only must obtain knowledge through the word of God, but you must adopt those very words into your being and behave as an ambassador of God. What you said in your post was ugly and rude and not the way God wants us to teach others.\n\n Proverbs 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility \n\nDid it ever occur to you that other people may be getting spiritually fed from the answers that are given to those who ask questions that you feel are not worthy of yoru time to answer them?
My gosh, I SO know what you mean!! You are completely entitled to your opinion. I'm going to share something with you. I worked with a girl for a long time whom I just despised because she did the same thing. I'd buy a certain type of shirt, the next day, she had one, I'd buy knee high boots, the following week she'd have brand new knee high boots, I'd bought a Honda, she bought a Honda, this went on for 7 years. The last year we worked together, her husband left her for the third time and she befriended me. I was much wiser than her so I helped her (even though part of me despised her, I tried very hard to look beyond it). In that time, I realized how screwed up her whole life had been even though she excelled a lot at work and was a very dominant figure-at work. At home, however, she was a coward who had no identity of her own because her mother had been so controlling. I put all the pieces of the puzzle together and realized that in copying me in everything, she was jealous of the fact that I was grounded and centered and she wasn't. She essentially was copying to try and find her own identity but couldn't. I was finally able to pity her as opposed to hating her and having to waste time and money in a therapist's office talking about it!!\n\nMy point is that you are totally centered and grounded. It is more than evident in your question and the way you ask it. You have your (*&^ together. They are completely lame for doing what they're doing and yes, they are classless. Totally classless. That is pretty much as low as you can go. \n\nAnd with it being your B-I-L, it's not like you can avoid them knowing because obviously your husband tells them. So I guess the only thing you can do is understand why (and that's why this comment is so long-sorry). And hopefully that will help you. Just know that people that do that are followers, not leaders. you are a leader, they are followers who know not where they're going. How sad. \n\nEven though that girl excelled at work more than I did because I didn't have it in me to backstab, suck up to the point of no dignity and what have you, I realized that my personal life was going to reward me so much more than work and that was all she had was work. All your b-i-l has is a directionless life with a wife who has no identity of her own. Can you just imagine what that thought process is like? It's not much!!!! Imagine what it's like to live your life with absolutely NO passion? You on the other hand have tons of passion, I can see it in your question!!! You're full of passion. So rest in comfort knowing that he and she are passionless people walking around looking for how they should exist. Looking for a way to fit in. \n\nFollowers never really lead. They always follow.

Preparing a body for the afterlife in ancient egypt was a very long and complicated process. The Egyptians believed that preserving the body in death was important to keep their soul alive. The Embalmers were priests who were trained in the mummification process. Mummification was a ritual, so the priests who participated were trained to perform the process with both surgical and ritual precision. The embalmers were required to work and labor outside of the town in a workshop called a “Wabet” or a clean place.\n\nThe head priest that supervised the ritual wore a terra-cotta mask in the form of Anubis. Anubis was the chosen god for surgeons, and for priests performing the mummification process. By wearing the mask of Anubis it symbolized Anubis watching over the mummification process to guide the priests in the ritual. It was important that the priest did not make any unnecessary cuts in the body, because if the spirit could not recognize the body it would be doomed to wonder across the Earth and possibly haunt the priest responsible.\n\nThe first step in the process was to make a cut in the abdomen, below the ribs, on the left side of the body. This first incision was done with a special flint knife, and all other cutting was done with an ordinary metal blade. They had to cut into the body so that they could take out special organs. Once the organs were removed they were placed in canopic jars, which were carved out of alabaster and inscribed with spells that would one day enable the organs to rejoin the body when it was resurrected. The organs that were placed in the jars include: stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver. Once inside the canopic jars each organ was protected by the one of sons of Horus whose head graced the lid.\n\nNext the brain would be extracted through the nose and then thrown away. Resin was then poured through the nose and into the skull with the use of a funnel, to keep the head from collapsing. The heart was left in place because later in the underworld Anubis would weigh the heart and guide the soul through the underworld. During the embalming process every part of the body was saved and either placed in the tomb with the body or given to the relatives of the deceased. Then, the body and organs were preserved with spices and dried out with natron salt. The spices that were used in the preservation process made the body look brown and leathery.\n\nThe entire preservation process took about 70 days. After the process was complete, the body was wrapped in linen. Death masks were placed on the head of the mummy around the bandages to be used as a replacement head incase something happened to the real skull. Special amulets were placed within the wrapping of the mummy to protect it. Finally, a “mummy tag,” similar to our toe tags, was placed around the mummy’s neck to help identify it for burial.

Bless you for even asking.\n\nCan you do it? Perhaps. You have no felony convictions, so you are not automatically prohibited from a number of positions. \n\nCrime scene analysis? Probably not. You're talking about working for a law enforcement agency, and I would think the chances of working for a agency while you're on probation are about slim and none.\n\nPreventing crimes against children? Very possible, though probably not within the criminal justice arena. Many private organizations do things like this, and you are uniquely qualified for a position in this field. \n\nHuman trafficking? Again, probably not within the criminal justice arena.\n\nWant to help out? It's always possible. Probably not as an employee, though...certainly not while on probation.\n\nWe can talk more, if you'd like...drop me a note at my user name at yahoo.com. \n\nSeriously...bless you for wanting to do something. I especially would like to see you get involved in preventing crimes against children, and you can certainly involve yourself in that field without having to work with or for a law enforcement agency. \n\nWonderful drug that meth is, huh? Sounds like it made a mess of your life...it would truly be wonderful if you can find a place in the world where you could help make things better.\n\nGood luck...write if you think I can offer more.
The United States is a very racially diverse country. According to the 2000 census, it has 31 ethnic groups with at least one million members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts.\n\nThe majority of Americans descend from white European immigrants who arrived at the establishment of the first colonies (most after Reconstruction). This majority--69.1% in 2000--decreases each year, and is expected to become a plurality within a few decades. The most frequently stated European ancestries are German (15.2%), Irish (10.8%), English (8.7%), Italian (5.6%) and Scandinavian (3.7%). Many immigrants also hail from Slavic countries such as Poland and Russia. Other significant immigrant populations came from eastern and southern Europe and French Canada.\nTop ancestries in 2000.\nEnlarge\nTop ancestries in 2000.\n\nHispanics from Mexico and South and Central America are the largest minority group in the country, comprising 12.5% of the population (2000 census). People of Mexican descent made up 7.3% of the population in the 2000 census, and this proportion is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.\n\nAbout 12.3% (2000 census) of the American people are African Americans (Blacks). African Americans are spread throughout the country, but their presence is largest in the South.\n\nAsian Americans--including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders--are a third significant minority (3.7% of the population in 2000). Most Asian Americans are concentrated on the West Coast and Hawaii. The largest groups are immigrants or descendants of emigrants from the Philippines, China, India, Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan.
Following may be the reason\n\n1. Check the rating of the plug and socket. Does they match?\n If the rating of socket is less than plug then replace socket.\n\n2. The plug maybe loosely fitting into the socket...match the plug with socket.\n\n3. Wires are loose in the socket / Plug. Open it and tighten the screw.\n\n4. Wires may be damaged due to excessive current. Replace the wires.
The preposition obviously depends on the context, \nI would translate it as "pro sanitate gentium", which literally means "for the health of all people(s)/tribes".
Here are the cost vs. benefits of taking Effexor\n\nWe'll start with the benefits.\nEffexor is a multiple reuptake inhibitor, which modulates two neuro transmitters in your brain, norepinephrine and serotonine. Once at a theraputic range, Effexor and take you out of the most deepest and darkest depression imagineable. \n\nHere are the cons (and they are not exaggerated)\nEffexor is the most addicting of all of the antidepressants on the market today. Not addicting in a way similar to fun drugs. Because of the complex way Effexor works, your brain wil become dependant to the point where Effexor may become a permanent part of your life. The withdrawal syndrome from effexor is the absolute worst amongst the serotogenic drugs. Due to the short elimination half life (amount of time it stays in yoru system) you can experience withdrawal by missing just one dose! Effexor is the hardest antidepressant to stop taking. Let's say you reach the therautic dosage of 300mg, you will have to taper off in 30mg incriments, per week. That means it will take at least 10 weeks to wean off, that is, if your brain lets you.\n\nEffexor is only recommended for deep deep depression and try taking anything else, unless it is your last resort.\n\nHope this helps

Why do you think it matters so much what the hater thinks about anyone? If someone hates another person - he or she is the one with the problem, regardless of what the other person did. You don't have control over another, you only have control over yourself. If this is where you want to invest your energy, don't expect the person you hate to give a damn. As a matter of fact, given your attitude, the other person may have beat you to it, but doesn't think you are worth the effort of displaying the hatred. Grow up, and get your own life.

Hi 'Error'. I am a retired Chiropractor. I have treated many patients with hernited discs. Many responded to chiropractic treatment and a few did not. Usually patients that did not respond to chiropractic care eventually improved with appropriate surgery. \n\nWhat has the Chiropractor told you and your husband? How has the herniated disc been diagnosed - MRI? CT? What level of the spine is involved? How large is the herniation? Are there any additional spinal conditions that might worsen the problem (e.g. spinal canal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis)? These types of issues help predict treatment success and/or the need for surgery.\n\nWhat are your husband's symtoms? Back pain only? Leg Pain? Leg pain only? Are there any signs of neurologic damage? Change in reflexes? Muscle weakness? Muscle atrophy (wasting)? Again, these issues help predict likelyhood of treatment success.\n\nLastly, if treatment is likely to help, some improvement should be seen within 3-4 weeks. Of course, if there is improvement, continuing treatment to maximum improvement can take many months. However, ongoing treatment without any significant improvement, month after month, with the hopes that 'in time' it will help, is not realistic.\n\nOops, one more point, if chiropractic treatment is unsuccessful for your husband, referral for a neurological consult should be the next step. At that point you want to see a Neurologist and NOT a surgeon. Neurologists specialize in DIAGNOSIS. They will not be motivated by 'surgical dollars' to prescribe surgery. While a surgeon would perform the surgery (note: spinal surgery should only be performed by a neurosurgeon - someone who specializes in spinal surgery), sadly, some surgeons never see a patient (with good insurance, of course) that doesn't need surgery.\n\nGood luck with Chiropractic. It often works wonders. But if surgery is needed, be sure to find the best.\n\nP.S. If you want to answer the questions I have listed here, I will check back and give your further feedback.

Many Christians look for forms of evil to confirm their own beliefs. Wicca is gaining popularity and Christianity is in decline. They blame Wicca for what they see as a decline in morals of the youth of the nation. Because they define any stray from christianity as a betrayal of God and all that is good. \n\nThey don't understand, nor do they care to understand, the concepts or purpose of our beliefs. They just look at it as a threat to the world they have created.\n\nA world where sex is evil.\nA world where magik is an abomination.\nA world where they can make laws that follow the rules of their religion and not the will of the people. \n\nThey are blind to everything else and so filled with ignorant hate that they lash out at us and try so hard to suppress it. \n\nSee you in 2042.

It depends on how it's used. :-) If the guy is really good at pleasing a woman, no sometimes it doesn't matter. In fact, the BEST sex I ever had was with a boyfriend that was only about 5 inches and only about as big around as a half dollar. But he KNEW how to use it and was VERY good at all the other things too. Also, I've been with a man that was quite large (in my book anyway): 10 inches, about 3 inches in diameter! I must admit, I never had good sex with him. He just didn't know what he was doing.

Parole is getting out of prison early. During the time out early, strick rules governing where one lives, works, interacts with others and such must be followed or it's back to prison again. \n\nEarly release on parole is based on good behavior. (Although some people are sentenced to prison with no chance of parole regardless of how good the behavior.) But even if someone has the chance of parole and has good behavior, they might not get out if their crime was horrendous or if the victim or the victim's family actively object to parole. \n\nThat's pretty much what I understand of it from watching TV.

Yes rattle....or whatever and to the asker, the CIA, which has positions globally (i.e. under the directorate of operations) has many jobs abroad (The NSA is more Stateside) that utilize this person as HAVING another "job".

You raise a really interesting question. It does seem a bit unfair that offenders, repeat or otherwise, of other crimes aren't required to register but sex offenders are. Quite frankly, I am surprised that someone hasn't tried to raise this issue already in the courts. \n\n I definitely see your point and I do sympathize; however, I can't say I agree whole hartedly. I think it is a good law per se even if it is somewhat discriminatory. What I don't like is the states that require the offender to register for life after the first offense. Reason being, there are some who are falsely accused and convicted of a crime they didn't commit and end up having to pay for it for the rest of their life. Now if they are accused and convicted a second time that is different. I also think the laws should be more specific as to which types of sex offenders should have to register rather than all of them. For example, in some states indecent exposure is a sex offense and those convicted have to register. If it is someone who is exposing themselves in a park i.e. a flasher then perhaps they should have to register. But, a young kid who moons someone, gets arrested for indecent exposure, and has to register as a sex offender is going bit far.\n\n I guess what the real problem is, there is no way to address this issue that is completely fair to all. But, by the same token, that doesn't mean it should be done away with either.

Prophecy:\nProphecy, in a broad sense, is the prediction of future events. The etymology of the word is ultimately Greek, from pro- "before" plus the root of phanai "speak", i. e. "speaking before" or "foretelling", but prophecy often implies the involvement of supernatural phenomena, whether it is communication with a deity, the reading of magical signs, or astrology. It is also used as a general term for the revelation of divine will. \n\nPrediction:\nA prediction is a statement or claim that a particular event will occur in the future. The etymology of this word is Latin (from præ- "before" plus dicere "to say").
This answer is not intended to justify it and only to explain a possible reason. I think it comes down to natural animal instinct.

I am a bit. I really sympathise with the people that saved with Farepak, but the reality is it is just for Christmas. There are people far worse off - what about the Farepak staff that have lost their jobs not just their Christmas savings? Why is no one talking about them. What about thepeople who work for companies that collapse and lose their pensions too? That affects their whole life - not what is essentially one day. I had saved some money for Christmas and a stupid woman crashed into our car (without insurance) so it has cost us a small fortune and our no claims and then my cat broke his leg and that cost £800. Christmas will be very low key for us (it usually is!) At the end of the day, I have my health and so do my family and we'll be together at Christmas and that's what is important - not a huge pile of presents.
Well really they dont forget they just choose to not think about it and but it out of their minds. Us women tend to hold on to things that we feel we will need to know at a later date. Men never forget they just choose not to think really.
Yes, it's extremely irritating. Regardless of the comments of those who say "enter public spaces at your own risk", in the name of civility and social order we owe each other some adherence to social norms. How would your detractors feel if someone decided to take a leak next to them at the bus stop? Hey-- if you're that uncomfortable around people, then maybe you shouldn't be taking public transit-- right? Where do we draw the line? Disregard for social space and reasonable social norms brings us to the level of pigs in a pen. Many people, as we know, are pigs.
well a tube in her lungs can mean several things. but it sounds she has had a rather difficult time.if she has problems with her lungs and there are unknown spots there abcesses it can be from many things,or a simple infection that settled in her lungs and her body isolated it and encapsulated the bug.\nor it can be from a systemic wide organism\nand it has simply gotten in enough places\nher body can no longer control its spread.\n until they know what it is be content she is doing ok.\nthey could be talking about doing a biopsy to see what it is,or chest tubes which you havent said if her lung has collasped.\nthey could be talking on mechanical ventilation also,which is placing a tuber in her lungs to right at the carina so air can go into both lungs s she can breath easier.\n or placing drainage tube into the abcess to drain it.\n so the bottom line is none is terrifcally major,except the illness its self.\n whether she has a bacterial infection in the lung or other reason, the major thing it sounds they are trying to control it and may have to let her rest on a ventilator till they can control the infection. saw on that they will give her medications and put her to sleep,and place a tube into her lungs and hook her up to a vent. they may keep her knocked out till they can treat the infection,and then get her back to breathing on her own.\n the next thing is is what kind of infection is it. there are bugs out there \nthat are not good to get, so without sounding crude simply relax until they know what they are dealing with.\n some of the bugs can totally destroy parts of the lung,others simply get isolated and encapsalated by the body.\n so the trick is is to get a direct specimen of the critter,and then grow it in the lab and test what kills it,in order to know how to treat her.\n oxygen isnt all that bad either,it is simply what the bug is and get samples in order to know how to treat it.\n if you wonder i do intensive care work,and tried to make things simple for easy understanding.\nshe has an infection and she has become very sick and they dont know what to treat her with yet.\n so relax some, and support her.\ndepending on what they find out will determine the rest.

The second part of the book(comprising most of the text) is a blend of a detailed and realistic survival memoir and a fantastic allegory in a medieval style. I personally feel that story contains both fable and allegory, the same as many books might be considered historical fiction. It's very interesting reading.
Tut was the son of Akhenaten and Kia. His stepmother was Nefertiti (remember the bust of this beautiful lady?)\n\nTut returned Egypt to the ways of the old gods after his father had gone to the one god concept and worship of Aten.\n\nHe died at age about 19. At first it was thought he was murdered, but recent study of the body shows he died of an infected leg wound. His tomb held many beautiful things. Some think that as he died so suddenly, and there was no tomb ready for him, someone else's tomb was used. There are signs that his name and identity were carved in over someone else's identity. There is even speculation that his father's tomb was robbed to fill Tut's tomb. People wanted to disrespect his father because of his one god concept.\n\nThere are tales of a curse placed on all who had anything to do with the opening of Tut's tomb-----so many died. But, coincidents happen, and there was no curse.

value-added tax \n\nA tax on the value added to a product at each stage of its production, from raw materials to finished product. Widely employed in Europe, value-added taxes have the advantage (for governments) of raising revenue “invisibly,” that is, without appearing as taxes on the bill paid by the consumer.

Well for one thing it explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus (as classical physics would predict). \n\nQuantum mechanical theory states that electrons will inhabit discrete energy levels (orbitals). Therefore it would only fall into the nucleus if it lost exactly the right amount of energy, but there is a limit to the energy values it can emit in the form of a photon. \n\nThe main point is that available energy values are not continuous and this why electrons fall into strictly defined orbits rather than just going anywhere they want to or colliding with the nucleus.

First of all, calm down and stop shouting. Your anger is also affecting your ability to form proper sentences and use spell check. To be able to communicate effectively with "the powers that be", make sure all your language skills are up to snuff.\n\nThat being said - you started out by saying that "I go to" a vocational school, and somewhere in there, it changed to "they kicked me out". Which is it? Have you been expelled?\n\nIf so, you have several options, and the ACLU isn't one of the more useful ones, as it doesn't appear that your expulsion is the by-product of any of your civil rights being violated.\n\nStart by asking the administration of the school to provide you with a detailed record of your history there, including grades on all tests/exams, as well as attendance. Will this record show that you were completing the coursework successfully? Will it show that you were there when you were supposed to be, and that all assignments were submitted on time, and passing grades were given to them?\n\nThe point is, the school has to be able to show that you were expelled because of not meeting the criteria for passing. You cannot be expelled simply because you (and another student, if I am to understand this correctly), brought a potentially unsafe condition to the attention of the appropriate party there.\n\nIf, after reviewing your records, you determine that you did, indeed, meet the criteria for passing, then your next step would be to call and request a meeting with the school's administrator. Ask that person to put in writing their reason(s) for expelling you. Have your records in your hand, and ask the administrator to review them, to give them an opportunity to rescind their decision to expel you. If, after doing this, the administrator still doesn't agree that the expulsion was unwarrented, then your next step would be to contact the governing agency for the school, likely the Michigan Department of Education (at the state level). You can find their phone number in the pink government pages of your phone book. Call them, explain your situation, and ask for a hearing (or whatever process they have in place to appeal the school's decision), and follow through on it.\n\nBe calm, be articulate, be prepared, and be ready to defend your record. If you do all this, it is pretty likely that you will be re-admitted, and given the opportunity to catch up on whatever was missed since the expulsion, in order to pass.\n\nPicketing the school - while giving you the opportunity to vent your outrage - will not further your cause. Rethink that "strategy".

DO NOT GET BIG FEET or snowblades as suggested by the person above, They have an incredibly high rate of injury on the mountain, most often incidents lead to head trauma. Person number two is right, you are looking for a forgiving flex, the degree to which it is soft for you is determined by your weight. So don’t go out and get a super soft ski unless you weigh ninety pounds. I would suggest a low level salomon scrambler 5, 6, or 7 series, or the K2 omni 4.5 to 5.5.

I told her God is too busy for this nonesence so I choose to pray at home and always keep Jesus and God in my heart.
There are several many ways India can become a powerful country:\n\n1) First of all, get rid of all the muslims!!! As long as this disease is in India, nothing positive is possible\n2) The government needs to be more effective in tackling all types of corruption. They should promulgate stiffer legislation for corruption, and people who report cases of corruption should be awarded.\n3) Education must be made mandatory until 18 years old.\n4) the size of the armed forces must be increased two fold and there should be a increase in defence expenditure.\n5) The government should make much easier for ordinary people to access education and business loans\n6) Indians should be encouraged to "save" more.\n7) The millions of people living in poverty should be trained to produce certain goods. Not only shall this enable them to work themselves out of poverty, but it shall be good for the level of Indian exports.\n8) India must undertake a much proactive effort to export goods to states, with whom our trade relations remain under developed and under utilised. These include South American, Eastern European and African states.\n9) Our strength lies in services. We should balance it out with production and manufacturing.\n10) In terms of foreign policy, we should augment relations with the USA, Israel, the EU states and Japan.\n11) Bodybuilding and Martial Arts (with a Hindu ethos) must be made compulsory in schools and colleges. This will allow the Hindu man to change the international stereotype of him being a docile weak figure into that of a tough testosterone god.\n12) Our economy must be excelled in every way possible. Services, Manufacturing, exports, savings,. At the moment India's natural resources remain ridiculously underdeveloped and under utilised. This includes oil. Oh and btw, the central forests (which Maoist rebels are occupying) are a rich source of aluminium.\n\nBefore we Indians can proceed to accomplish the aforementioned. We must examine the encumbrances and obstacles that we face. These include\n\n1) India's unwanted Muslim population\n2) Corruption\n3) Over population\n4) inefficiency in government and bureaucracy\n5) apathy on the part of Indians\n6) lack of funds, initiative and professionalism\n7) lack of patriotism and nationalism among Indians

In most respects, they're pretty close. (Details of the 747 vary by model.)\n\nThe wingspan of the 747-400ER, a current model, is over 211 feet. The wingspan of the Galaxy (C-5a) is about 223 feet.\n\nThe 747-400ER is about 232 feet long. The Galaxy is about 247 feet long.\n\nThe heights are about the same, at almost 64 feet for the 747-400ER and about 65 feet for the Galaxy.\n\nThe maximum takeoff weight for the 747-400ER is 910,000 pounds; for the Galaxy, it's 840,000.\n\nBoeing has announced a bigger version of the 747, the 747-8. It will have a wingspan of almost 225 feet, a length of as much as 250 feet, and a height between 63 and 64 feet. The maximum takeoff weight will be 960,000 pounds.\n\nBut, even though the new 747 will be definitely bigger, it still won't have the cool front-and-rear cargo ramps and a cargo bay big enough to drive a tank through, like the Galaxy does.
Canada and the US cooperate on protecting our mutual border in a way Mexico does not, so we feel more confident on that side of the nation. However, even Canada has said recently that its amnesty grants have jumped proper checking for terrorist ties, and I understand they will be addressing that, going forward.\n\nI think we need to protect all of our borders.

yes, but sometimes one service has features that 'accidentally' prevent you from accessing all of the features on the trial offer. I cannot name names sorry I like my service, and they have my puter bugged.

I guess it depends which side of the fence you are on this rivalry,\nbut I have found a few.
Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Russia, Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Canada, Mexico, Aruba, Jamaica, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru. \nWant to visit: Australia but must of all New Zeland.\n I´ts very hard to figure out, but the best place in the world i guess is: Italy.

You find midpoint by adding the 2 x-coordinates of the endpoints and dividing by 2, and doing the same for the y-coordinates. So if you know the midpoint and one end, it looks like this (assume the other endpoint is (x,y):\n\n(4+x)/2 = 10; (-4+y)/2 = 12\n\nMultiply by 2:\n4+x=20; -4+y=24\n\nSo x=16 and y=28
The government already spends money on the environment. Why would we need another tax to be mismanaged by the Ministry of Finance, or RCA?
Will The Democratic Party Regain Control of Congress?\nOr Will They Only Win 1 Chamber?\n\nIt's my opinion unless a miracle happens the best they can hope for would be the House. I don't think they will pull off a sweep like the Republicans did in 1994. I'm still amazed that happened.\n\nOr Will The Republican Party Still Retain Control?\n\nThis would be my guess. Republicans don't lose either House of Senate. Off year elections are about state races. Do you like your person or not. President's popularity has little effect.\n\nIf, you think the Democrats will win control of 1 chamber, which 1 is it going to be? The Senate or The House? \n\nIF the Democrats win one house it will be The House. There all 435 seats are up for re-election. In the Senate there are only 33 maybe 34 seats up for re-election. Democrats would have to win a greater percentage of the races in order to retake the Senate.\n\nNancy Pelosi Speaker of the House..\nHarry Reid Senate Majority Leader..\nDoes it have a nice ring to it?\n\nI'm a moderate. I'm not rabid for either side. Harry whould be OK if he goes a little less combative. Nancy? The thought of her really being in charge of anything of importance makes me nauseous.\n\nRemember I'm one of those people who really determine who's running this country. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. In 1994 the Democrats got kicked out because the swing voters were tired of what the liberals were pushing AND what the Republicans were advocating seemed like a good alternative.\n\nUs swingers may be tired of what the Republicans are pushing, but Democrats aren't offering anything as an alternative but 'We aren't Republicans'. That doesn't resonate with me. Talk to me. Tell me what you really want to do and how you plan to pay for it. \n\nThat how you plan to pay for it is the most important part of what I want to know. Especialy since Democrats have gotten on the 'We're spending too much' bandwagon lately.\n\nCongress IS there for the taking. But if you want my vote I'm going to have to like what I'm hearing. And if all I'm hearing is the Republicans are wrong. That may be true but if Democrats don't tell me how they are going to do differently, how do I know they won't be worse?
WRONG! The simple surgical procedure does not effect the man, except made his pride in any way. After my husband had a vasectomy we had more sex than before, because he was much less worried it would result in another pregnancy. Tell him to suck it up and be a man, and get the operation, or you could have your tubes tied, which cost 3 times as much, he could take time off his job to care for the children and household chores while you recuperate for about 6 weeks! And absolutely no sex for at least 6 weeks, if you have to have the operation.......Seriously, they are only uncomfortable for maybe a couple of days!
I'm in love with someone of the other side of the globe literally. If it's 10am here, it's 10pm on her side of the globe. it's damn hard.\n\nSince you've got more options than I do and I wish I'm in your shoes right now. If I'm in your shoes right now, I'd call. \n\nLet me see, I'm a guy and you're a girl. We have a different position but the same case. If I'm the guy, whatever you do doesn't really matter if I don't like you. If I like you, I'd enjoy getting in touch with you. \n\nHow long have you been friends or acquaintance? It really depends how you know each other.

I'm not sure if there are any places that have illustrations, but many sites give descriptions of medications as far as color, numbers, shapes, etc. If you have a pill and don't know it's identity, you should trash it, plain and simple. Unless of course, you found it in your child's (or someone you take care of) belongings, and want to get down to a possible problem. If you want pictures, head to the library or a book store - everyone has The Pill Book - Guide to prescription medications. It has pictures and descriptions for meds. Good luck!

Mathematics is the study of quantity, structure, space and change. It developed, through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, from counting, calculation, measurement, and the study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.
this depends on how old you are because if you are between 15 and 30 years old 45 kgs is too light and may be at risk of becoming anorexic if you are trying to put on weight i suggest you see a doctor 65 kgs is a more healthy weight and a doctor will be able to help you do it healthily 20 kgs is a lot to put on in two months cant understand 'pounds' that's too hard to work out i think 5 pounds equals 2 kgs good luck see a doctor
All inks are not created equal. From the base of the chemical composition to colorants and additives, there are many varying combinations used when ink formulas are composed. Of the three chemical bases used to formulate inks, water and petrochemical solvents are most common. The third and most atypical base used is oil, found mainly in wide-format commercial printers.\n\nThe colorant, or the substance used to give color to the ink, is either dye or pigmentation. Dye, consisting of small molecules, blends with the water-based solution. A water-dye based ink tints or stains the paper on a molecular level. Because the dye is composed of single molecules it lays flatter on the paper surface reflecting light more evenly and appearing more vivid. However, the smaller molecular structure of the dye-based ink also allows it to be damaged by UV light more rapidly that pigmented inks.\n\n Pigmented colorant is insoluble. The pigment consists of much larger molecules than that of the dye, therefore the reflection of light received from a pigmented print does not appear as vibrant due to the scattering of the reflected light. The larger molecules do allow a pigmented ink's print to last substantially longer than a dye-based ink's print. \n\n In recent years hybrid ink consisting of both dyes and pigmentation has been introduced to the market. These inks are being used in the latest line of Epson printers. The hybrid dye/pigment ink is also referred to as archival inks. The company claims that their archival inks will last twice as long as pigmented ink, close to 200 years.\n\n In addition to the chemical base and colorant, inks also contain additives. Additives may include buffering agents for control of the inks pH levels, resin for resilience, and humectants for the prevention of evaporation. Other ingredients added to many types of ink may include fungicides, surfactants, and biocides. Each ink formula has a unique formulation of each additive, again causing dramatic differences in the final outcome. \nI hope this helps!

Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, is a family of technologies that provide digital data transmission over the wires used in the "last mile" of a local telephone network. Typically, the download speed of DSL ranges from 128 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s depending on DSL technology and service level implemented. Upload speed is lower than download speed for ADSL and symmetrical for SDSL.\n\nA leased line is a (usually) symmetric telecommunications line connecting two locations together. Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected to the other. They can be used for telephone, data or Internet services.

Ken Roberts......... what can be said about this guy? He's a master at selling trading educational tools with astronomical profit margins. He steers average people towards really risky investments as well.\n\nHaving said all that. It was Ken Roberts who first gave me a glimpse into the life of a trader. I have read similar stories from other traders as well. After I bought his fist course, I became a qualified I.A. and spent several years working on the street. Since then I've learned to trade well with more risk and I have insane returns.\n\nI honestly believe that Ken Roberts looked at what William O'Neil was doing in the eighties and saw a massive market. Ken Roberts Co. is an over priced, more risky, and less educational knock off of the William O'Neil Co.\n\nI don't have an opinion on TOVI. Hope this helps.

Belief in miracles is a concept. But faith in god an absolute necessity.\n\n\nBefore we proceed discussion on miracles, we need to understand the meaning of miracles. What does it actually mean? What does actually happen when we hear someone say, "a miracle has happened"?\n\nThe famous Ganesha episode drinking the milk was the biggest miracle of all the times.\n\n\nMiracles are not to be. No human being on earth can create a miracle. It can never happen. Yes, some people... some renowned Saints while pursuing their Spiritual career gain some Tantric powers which helps them healing the needy.\n\nIt so happened a poor man turned up in presence of Bhagwan Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism and asked him for help. In his hands was the dead body of his young son. He begged of Bhagwan Mahavira to put back life into his son. Mahavira point blank refused... he stated he does not have the power to put life into someone... neither it is possible for any other human being to do so. Neither he could perform even a single miracle.\n\n\nHe repeatedly emphasized that every human being has the power within to invoke the positive energy of the Cosmos. This only happens when we develop a positive attitude towards life. This is practically what is being done in Reiki. Summing up in Reiki, one is taught to invoke the positive energy source and use it for curing the defective area of the body. It is like chanelising all the power within the means of human being towards a particular area as happens in the case of a dam.\n\nIn any hydroelectric project the principal means of generating energy is... a huge quantity of water is stored in a lake and this raw water is made to stand for a while. After the sedimentation of the particles floating in the water has occurred... the clear water is passed through tunnels, the starting point of which is located on a much higher platform than the outer end of the tunnel. This makes the water gush out with great pressure. This water is made to pass through a turbine before it reaches the outer end. The rotation of the turbine generates electricity.\n\n\nMere channelising of water through a tunnel which has a very steep slope and keeping a turbine in the path of the water generates the requisite energy... similarly if we need to heal our body... we need to concentrate all the positive energies which either exist in the body or can be invoked from the mighty reservoir of Cosmos and directed towards a particular goal. This goal can be healing the ailing body or even pursuing a higher goal in life.\n\nIf we look at the matter deeply... the student who comes first in the class and the student who comes last... there is not much difference except in their thinking. The one who comes first sincerely concentrates his total energies towards the desired goal of life. The one coming last has yet to find a definite goal in life. One who comes last fritters away his energy to no avail.\n\n\nWhenever we expect of a saint to perform a miracle... what actually happens is that the words of the saint inspires us and makes us concentrate our energies towards a particular goal. Sometimes, he gives a Mantra to be chanted many times... or explains logically how the desired results can be achieved. Repetition of Mantras results in invoking positive energy from the Cosmos.\n\nYou and your brother have surrounded your mental self by negative energies... both of you have a habit of thinking negative. You have to change your attitude towards life... you need to think broad... you just cannot continue being narrow-minded. The more we think bad of someone... the negative flow of energy reflects back upon us. With passage of time this negative energy accumulates and there comes a time when hell breaks loose... the body unable to sustain the negative flow of energy falls ill.\n\n\nThe moment you understand this crux of life... you shall never need a miracle ever. You have within you the mightiest source of energy in the Cosmos.

A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time!
Spam email will disappear when it is no longer economically feasible for the spammers. As long they can send out a few million spam emails and make a couple of million dollars on that they will continue to do it. SO the answer lies with people who receive the spam email NEVER responding to or buying anything from a spam email they have received. It's not the spammers' fault that these spam emails keep coming; it's the fault of the people who receive them and respond with wads of cash.\n\nThis is the same reason why prostitution is still going strong after thousands of years: there is a market for it that is positively insatiable.

The lunar effects on tides are actually quite predominant on the effects of weather and air so to speak it is actually barometric pressure that is affected by not directly my lunar pull. The lunar pull on water affects the variable barometric pressure. The tides also play into this as currents affect wind patterns High and low pressure spots therefor affecting barometric pressure. (the high ad lows are actually descriptives of barometric pressure areas so it is kinda redundant.) You should look at NOAA web sites. You might be able to fine very good layman's answer.

Depends on how close your friend is. Is it someone you really care about? Is it someone you counldn't be bothered if you never talked to again. If you are friends, and the friend asked you not to talk with him/her, you have the right to know why and demand an explanation. Because if it was something you did, you would get the chance to apologize. If it was for no reason, then you know where you stand from such a person. Only you can decide that! :) Good luck

Because they expected that you meant those words, not that you didn't even remember when you said them. It would probably also be because they felt that way about you.\n\nSaying "I love you," in the heat of the moment is wrong, and girls should realize that. Some are young or innocent, though, and don't. So, don't say those precious words unless you mean them.

The principals of Stage Magic are the same today as they were centuries ago. They have a text from the days of the Inquisition, written by a stage magician of then, explaining the tricks, and how they were entertainment, and not powers of the Devil. Being accused of Witchcraft, and consorting with the Devil, was a real danger for a stage magician at that time. The things it describes from then, are the same as they are today.\n\nMisdirection, and Optical illusions. All the same. Making you look Where the magician wants you to look, and not where he doesn't want you to look, and fooling the eye into thinking it sees, what it really isn't seeing...\n\nThese are the same tools used by all, and used fo hundreds of years...Chris Angel just puts it into a more "Heavy Metal" package, and gives it a really different spin, but it's still the same stuff.

So many and answers- I have systemic lupus along w/other health problems and take a b complex daily. It's a liquid taken sublingually because B12 isn't absorbed well thru the stomach.\nSublingual B Total™\nLiquid B Vitamin Supplement is the one I use and recommended by my doctor.\n\nVitamin B12 - helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells. Works in close partnership with folic acid in synthesis of the building blocks for DNA and RNA. Essential for the integrity of the maintenance of the nervous system and for the production of energy producing molecules. Non toxic at 1,000 mcg daily for many years.\n\nFolic Acid (folate) - a non-toxic nutrient that protects our chromosomes from DNA damage. Also helps with depression. No noticeable side effects.\n\nVitamin B2 (riboflavin) - required for cell growth and release of energy, formation of red blood cell, and synthesis of antibodies.\n\n\nVitamin B3 (niacin) - stabilizes cell membranes, insures proper circulation and maintains healthy skin. Aids in the function of the nervous system and helps to reduce cholesterol.\n\nVitamin B5 (panthothenic acid) - a non toxic nutrient needed to breakdown fat to covert into energy. An anti-stress vitamin. \n\nVitamin B6 - needed for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are required for normal nerve cell communication.
No, nighthawk is an idiot. I'm fairly certain historical records of climate would show an increase in global temperature - but then if you engage your brain for one second you'd realise thats because we'd already started to effect the environment by the time we started recording climate!\n\nTo be honest, the 10 year time window is bull. We're not really sure exactly what is going to happen or when. This isn't because scientists are idiots, its because the Earth is a complex system that has been operating for 4.5 billion years - we're still learning how it works.\n\nWhat we do know is that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has more than doubled since the industrial revolution, and that can be attributed to humans, not natural processes. I don't think we can reverse what we've done before we see more drastic effects (last years hurricane season was justa taster).\n\nHowever, the world isn't going to flood overnight. The Earth is actually a very robust system...it will look after itself. Natural buffers in the system will give humanity time to study, learn and then mitigate the hazards of global warming.

Jumping Rope\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a "miss". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only

I think that it is not a law against that unless there is sound on the tape. Not because it is okay but because it is one of those laws that is behind the technology available to us now.

i think you should do your own homework.\n\nbut, a good place to start is to understand the basic idea. ultraviolet light is higher in energy than visible light, which means that it can cause damage to living cells. this is why you get sunburned when you go out during a sunny day - sunlight also has some ultraviolet component and the damage done to your skin cells causes your skin to get red and tender. \n\nsince you are a big organism, the UV won't kill you - unless you stay out in very, very bright sunlight for a long time. then you'll get seriously burned and probably get sick and possibly die from an infection. however, a small organism like bacteria is usually only a single cell! so the UV will damage their tissue enough to kill the bacteria.\n\ngood luck!

There are three main types of juices - citrus juicers, centrifugal juicers, and masticating juicers.\n\nThe citrus juicers are for citrus only - oranges, grapefruits and the like.\n\nMost juicers are probably the centrifugal type - they have an internal basket that goes around in a circle. These types are good for carrots, apples, etc.\n\nThe third type is generally considered the best - the masticating juicers. These juicers more or less "chew" up the vegetables and they produce more juice of better quality than the centrifugal - 24 ounces more juice per 10 pounds of carrots. \n\nThe Breville juicers are very high end centrifugal juicers and cost around $200 to $400. (800JEXL) They have a wide mouth that will fit an entire apple without cutting it first. I used a Waring JEX328 for more than two years and it worked very well for me at a much cheaper price - around $60.\n\nI recently bought a Champion 2000+ juicer, and I like it much better than the Waring juicer, and I liked the Waring juicer a lot. The Champion juicer is a masticating juicer and runs around $250. One of the nice features is that the pulp comes out the end of the tube, so you can set a large bowl there to collect it and can easily dump it and continue juicing. It's also easier to clean.\n\nI mostly juice carrots and similar vegetables. I've heard other juicers work better for wheat grass. You can also buy an attachment for the champion juicer to make nut butters and even to make flour from grains; however, if that is your primary purpose, there might be a better specialized machine.\n\nIn summary, if budget allows, I would recommend a champion juicer, and if you are on a tight budget, i would recommend the Waring centrifugal juicer.

one word answer - yes!!
See what bacteria are on your hands after you wash them with different kinds of soap versus just rinsing them with water. The trick is getting the starting point to be the same. I think what you'd need to do is wipe your hands down with alcohol and have a source of bacteria (a piece of raw chicken could work) that you rub your hands on each time. I would imagine something like: rinse your hands with ethanol (to kill whatever is already there), touch the bacteria source, wipe your fingers on a control plate (if you don't have proper aguar plates, you can use chicken broth as per the experiment above), wash your hands with the soap to be tested, and wipe your hands on another plate. Rinse your hands with enthanol again and repeat for other soaps and plain water. Leave the samples to grow overnight (or longer) and compare the bacteria growth on the different plates.\n\n___________________\nI just thought of another experiment that could be really cool... Leave your plates (or chicken broth, or whatever) out in the air for a while, so they get both mold and bacteria growing on them. Let them grow for a while, and observe the locations of bacteria in relation to mold. That's how Alexander Flemming discovered penicillin!
Here is the BIGGEST problem with this situation: You wrote::\n\n"I'm very bitter supporting him all these years living with all his rules due to the OCD.And he still won't marry me."\n\nTHAT MY CHILD IS BEING A HYPOCRIT. You are angry and resentful and WANT TO GET MARRIED? What is wrong with you and millions of others??? Is marrying him going to magically fix this? Hell no! I would say go to counseling alone and let your therapist talk some sense into you. You are failing to see that you can't trap people into making you feel better about something. Make a choice about what you want "FOR THE RIGHT REASONS" not because of your insecurities. This is absurd and it's what's hugely wrong with the world. People get married to FIX things and MARRIAGE DOES NOT FIX ANYTHING. IT PERPETUATES AN ALREADY EXISTING PROBLEM.

all reactions are going both ways. for instance, H2 + O2--->H2O ( I know it's not balanced) also goes from H2O---->H2 + O2. A 100% yield is never acheived because the reaction reaches a state of equilibrium where the reactants are going from H2 + O2--->H2O just as fast as they are going from H2O--->H2 + O2.\n\nAn entire semester of inorganic chemistry is devoted to the concept of equalibrium.

Catholism has a lot of mixture, therefore many of the traditions, rites and sacraments, are not to be found in the Bible, or in the ancient Christian doctrine even Paul mention it on 1st Timothy 4:1-3 1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3 Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. Hislop says that when the cult to Cibeles an acient babylon godess was established in Pagan Rome, it was established in its primitive form, with a celibate priesthood!!! *The two Babylons Alexander Hislop).\n\nSo my friend Celibacy is not a CHRISTIAN doctrine it has it's origin in pagan cults, and was introduced to the catholic church, and also fathom this How did the Apostle Peter alledglly the first Pope, had a mother in law?????? Even their first pope wasn't celibate right!!

I do my banking onlline, I've done this for a few years. I do it to save money. I don't have very good control of myself when it comes to money. I always pick banks that are not local so I can't go into the branch and get moeny, and I hate paying ATM fees so I very rarely get money out. I've went through Citibank and loved them, I'm currently with Washington Mutual (Wamu) and I like them too. I have direct deposit and pay all my bill by mail. I use my card at the pump for gas and as a credit at the grocery store. You really don't need cash these days even McDonald's take cards so I feel more comfortabke like this. I don't know what your reasoning for doing it is but there's nothing wrong with it.

In the first half of the last century, America was on the rise in the world, and there seemed to be an exuberance in the language, which is sort of silly in retrospect. From earlier slang like "absquatulate", they moved on to stuff like "twenty-three skidoo" and finally to the song "Mairzy Doats". So, after finding the following on the web, I vote for "it just sounded nutty in an American way" so people liked it:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary records the expression bee's knee as meaning the type of something small or insignificant from 1797. The plural form is US slang dating from the 1920s, when there was an explosion of terms meaning 'the acme of excellence': compare the cat's whiskers/pyjamas. The first example is dated 1923. Some of these have lasted, and some have not (the flea's eyebrows, the canary's tusks).\n\nOR \n\nA bee's "corbiculae", or pollen-baskets, are located on its\ntibiae (midsegments of its legs). The phrase "the bee's knees", meaning "the height of excellence", became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along with "the cat's whiskers" (possibly from the use of these in radio crystal sets), "the cat's pajamas" (pyjamas were still new enough to be daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure: "the eel's ankle", "the elephant's instep", "the snake's hip". Stories in circulation about the phrase's origin include: "b's and e's", short for "be-alls and end-alls"; and a corruption of "business".
Catholics are Christians\nMethodists are Christians\nBaptists are Christians\nLutherans are Christians\n\nAnyone who believes in Jesus Christ is a CHRISTian.\n\nIf you are talking about the difference between Catholics and Protestants then there is a lot more different that the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Well......there are so many......and I look like a lady, so the best thing is the shock value!!! \n\nThis is a good question, it's got me thinking. I have strong feelings about this!!! I really do not like it when people use c**t as a form of abuse - because its abusive to women. I know there are male equivalent, but as a woman I don't mind so much....and though I'm not a Christian, I don't like religious words used for swearing.....apart from that, anything goes.\n\nI didn't want my infant son to swear, so I started saying "Oh BASINGSTOKE!!!" all the time, and it worked...if he said it, I said "Shhh! Don't say that!" just like a normal parent would if their child said fuck. He grew up OK but I've probably offended a lot of people who live in Basingstoke.\n\nI like it when people are creative and don't just say one thing all the time, because it loses its impact.\n\nI guess my favourite swear word changes every so often, but probably the main one is Oh Sh*t... I'm going to think about this some more and invent some new ones.
Your first appointment is a consultation. They will explain the procedure and payment options and maybe x-rays after a down payment is made and a contract is signed.\n\nBands and brackets are up to the orthodontist. My orthodontist used brackets on molars. My daughter had bands on some molars, but she went to a different orthodontist. I think brackets are more comfortable.\n\nYour baby tooth will have to be extracted by your dentist. Your orthodontist will explain this to you after x-rays are taken. My daughter had baby teeth that wouldn't come out naturally and had to have dental surgery to remove them. Not all baby teeth need surgery.\n\nYes, the adult teeth will have brackets, but sometimes, baby teeth will not fall out naturally. The baby tooth has to come out so that the adult tooth will come in.\n\nYour orthodontist will explain everything to you. Sometimes other dental appliances are necessary. My daughter had a device that expanded her arch. She also had an appliance that corrected her cross bite.\n\nDon't be worried about anything. Modern dentistry and orthodontics are wonderful. There is an adjustment period after the braces, but you will adjust in no time. Good luck and remember it won't be long and you will have a beautiful smile and beautiful teeth.
OK - this is easier this way - The number of nickles is one less than 3 times the sum of dimes and nickles. Get rid of that one less by adding another nickle to the calculation and making it 64 coins and $5.50. \n\nNow the equation is 3 times the amount of nickles to the sum of the amount of quarters and dimes makes $5.50.\n\nBasically that means 3 times a number, plus that same number (which is really three times and one time is 4 times) makes 64 coins. So to make it easier, 4 times that number makes 64 coins. - and when you divide 64 by 4 - you get 16.\n\nNow back to the original equation - you have 3 times as many nickles as you have the sum of dimes and quarters - so 3 times 16 is 48. 48 times $.05 is $2.40.\n\nSubtract $2.40 from $5.50 and you are left with $3.10. \n\nNow, 16 coins have to equal that $3.10. if there were an equal amount of dimes and quarters the amount would be $2.80 - so there must be more quarters than dimes to make that amount higher - the answer is 10quarters - 6 DIMES\n\nI'm sorry about the explanation - its usually easier for someone to show another than to type it to them. :)

Somebody's been watching too many Woody Allen movies. I never heard anyone talk like that. It sounds forced, contrived, totally fake. Cryptic speeches don't usually come into normal loving relationships. At worst, it sounds like he's setting you up for a fall. At best, he's trying to sound overly impressive, but he's either going way over you head, or he just sounds precocious. Many people would use choice words like "prick" to describe this stuffed shirt. And no, it's not because he's older, it's because he's in love with the sound of his own voice.\n\nMy advice would be to distance yourself from this guy and look forward to the day you meet your prince.
Sex cause it's not everything.... No really it's not!
Ouch! That would certainly upset me. I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years (I'm 19 next week, he's 23) and there's no way I'd be happy about waiting 10 years. We're planning on getting engaged within the next year and then I want to wait 3 years before getting married. I think I would be very hurt about waiting 10 years personally.\n\n I think his intentions are pure. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have a stable life before you get married, he's probably wanting to be able to provide you with a wonderful life for when you get married.\n\nMy suggestion to you would be to talk to him, tell him how you're feeling- make sure you explain that you understand why he would want to wait but tell him that you want to get married before 10 years and you don't mind if everything's not perfect when you get married. You love him and you want that commitment.\n\nIf he still insists on waiting then it's up to you if you think he's worth waiting for or if it would be best for both of you to move on.\nYou don't want to be bitter about the wait by the time you do get married!\n\nAt the end of the day if he's the one you want to spend the rest of your life with the 10 year wait isn't long when it comes to spending the rest of your lives together..\n\n\n-Elise

I think it depends on the terms of the prenup. What are you trying to protect or insure does or doesn't happen. Those are important factors to consider. Also i'm assuming she wasn't present for the construction of this agreement so were her interests considered? I would approach the subject openly and honestly, expect that feelings will get hurt so choose your words carefully and be considerate of her feelings and the fact that you are springing this on her, how would you feel is the situation was reversed?

When salt NaCl dissolves in water H2O what happens is that the Na dissasociates from the Cl and we get Na+ surrounded by OH- ions, and H+ surounded by Cl- ions. \n\nSo essentially we have a lot of ions that are free to move, and where there are free ions there are free electron, and where there are free electrons there is high conductivity.
Starting with the grip:\nYou probably want to use a 'Semi-Western' or a 'Western' forehand grip. Essentially you want to hold the racquet as you would a frying pan, making sure you grip it at the very bottom of the grip.\n\nThe swing:\nTo start you racket head wants to be back and lower than where you want to make contact with the ball, keep your arm reasonably close to your side.\nContact with the ball is the most imporant part of the swing, the 'contact point' wants to be in front of your body, idealy at around net height, your racket heads wants to be pressing forwards and up.\nTo finnish the shot you want to keep your eyes on where you made contact with the ball, your racket head finnishes up high over your shoulder and your hips and shoulders should be 'squared' to the net.\n\nTo really learn a top spin forehand you want to get on a tennis court with someone that can either teach you, or knows how to hit one and you can watch their technique.\n\nPlayers like Rafael Nadal hit with alot of topspin so I would recommend you watch him play on TV if you have the chance, and Roger Federer is awesome and everyone can try and learn from him.
Well let's see:\n\nOil Shale:\nPositives- Can extract a large amount of petroleum products from a source that is largely untapped.\nNegatives: The process is time consuming and requires the use of fossil fuels.\n\nEthanol:\nPositives: Burns more cleanly and isn't derived from a nonrenewable source.\nNegatives: There is not enough plant matter out there to satisfy all energy needs.\n\nCoal:\nPositives: With new clean coal technology, coal can satisfy much of the energy needs while polluting less.\nNegatives: Still dirty, still nonrenewable, and still dangerous to mine.\n\nNuclear:\nPositives: "Clean" since it does not technically produce ozone-depleting gases; fuel has the potential to provide nearly unlimited energy.\nNegatives: Nuclear waste is an environmental and political nightmare; most nuclear plants are not highly profitable given the cost of fuel, maintenance, safety and other considerations.\n\nSolar:\nPositives: Very clean, renewable and unlimited.\nNegatives: Equipment expense makes it cost-proibitive- for now. Solar plants generally do not generate sufficient power for large metropolitan areas.\n\nWind:\nPositives: Very clean and renewable.\nNegatives: Equipment, as with solar power, is expensive.\n\nHydroelectric:\nPositives: Clean and renewable. Can generate significant amount of power.\nNegatives: There aren't enough huge rivers, like the Colorado, Amazon, and Nile, to power a hydroelectric plant of large scale everywhere. Very costly.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells:\nPositives: Efficient and very clean- end product is water- and renewable. Has portability.\nNegatives: You must expend the same energy making the hydrogen (as from a hydrocarbon molecule) as you get out of it. Net: no energy gain. Usually fossil fuels are required to process hydrogen. Hydrogen is not readily available. Cost prohibitive for mass market as of now.\n\n\nTaken individually, neither one of these alternatives will replace our energy needs. One of the biggest problems which typical renewable energy sources have had (such as wind, solar, hydroelectric) is that they are not portable. That is, you can't simply strap on a huge solar panel to your car and start it up. While it is true that batteries can be recharged with energy from wind, solar, or hydroelectric, the conventional batteries we have today- the lead-acid types we see in cars- do not provide sufficient power (even if you add a bunch of them in series) for trips of long duration.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells solve the problem of portability and power: all you really need is a source of hydrogen. That hydrogen can be condensed so that there is a sufficient supply to last several hundred miles (researchers are working on improving this). But hydrogen itself is not readily available. In fact, we have very little of it on earth because it all tends to float up into outer space.(it being the lightest gas).\n\nOne way to solve this is to take a hydrocarbon molecule- such as methane- and remove the hydrogen. But removing the hydrogen requires energy. So even though hydrogen and oxygen combine in a fuel cell to yield energy, that energy is about the same as that required to displace the hydrogen from a hydrocarbon. So why would anyone want to have fuel cells if the net energy gain is zero?\n\nWell, because of that portability issue again. Say we have a solar, wind, hydroelectric, or even nuclear plant that produces electricity. While that electricity is not portable, we can use it to power up a hydrogen-generating power plant. We, in effect, transfer the energy from a renewable source into hydrogen, which we can then use at hydrogen "gas" stations. \n\nSome environmentalists claim that because hydrogen necessitates a hydrocarbon source, we're still using the nonrenewable hydrocarbons we were using with petrol. They further claim that this makes the whole process non-clean. These claims are valid only in the sense that today we are, indeed, using nonrenewable fuel
Kegel exercises are the main way to increase vaginal tone. Gently tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor as if you were trying to stop the flow of urine or a bowel movement. Hold for 5-10 seconds, then release. Repeat 5 times, three times a day at first, then slowly increase the number. \n\nThese exercises will also help reduce swelling and reduce the risk of complications later on, like urinary dribbling and incontinence.

Dude, it really doesn't take that long to get a six-pack. I started working out in January, and have one now (after not working out for years). Here's what you do:\n\nWork out 3 times a week, doing about 20 mins of cardio (rowing machine is great for abs, and upper body) and 40-70 minutes of weights (including abs). Target each muscle group in your weight-training workout, doing about 3 sets of 9-12 reps on each muscle group except abs (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings, and calves). Focussing on proper form instead of heavier weight, will cause you to grow and be cut a lot better and faster.\n\nFor abs specifically, use a decline-situp bench, and do as many twist crunches as you can (twist to one side at the top of each crunch, then twist to the other side, alternating). Then use an ab roller, going straight, for as many reps as you can. Next, do leg-lefts (keeping your legs straight) to target your lower abs.\n\nIn a few weeks, you should have a great 6-pack! : )
Let me warn you of something.\n\nIf you were to pay off this bill, and IF the creditor notifies the credit bureau, your account is changed to "paid". However, it will still show that you had late payments, or that the account was in collections. This is still a negative item on your report, and it will still hurt your score.\n\nDoes it make sense to pay off your bill and still have bad credit?\n\nThe problem is that the only way you can get a negative item removed is for the creditor to tell them to remove it. There is no other way (except to go through the dispute process and hope the creditor does not respond to the investigation). \n\nWhat I advise people to do is negotiate with the creditor. Tell them that in exchange for paying off the bill, they must agree IN WRITING to remove all negative information from your credit report. \n\nSee the link below for more info.

If you area novice web designer then I agree with what most people say here, the client pays. In fact, I would not even disguise it in your prices, have them establish the service and then provide you the administrator/anonymous FTP access. I think the going rate for novice development of web pages in my area (Texas) is $50 per page. A web designer should get in and get out, which means no continuing requirements with web hosting fees. If, on the other hand, you are a web administrator, then you are talking more long term commitment. The only way I would suggest holding onto the hosting fees if you lease a presence on the web and sub-divide that presence among your clients. Many ISPs allow that and you collect the aggregate coin and pay the one flat rate to the ISP. It's up to you, but novice should stay simple.

Erythropoiesis is regulated by erythropoietin, which increases in the presence of hypoxia and regulates RBC production. In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production, so chronic renal failure is associated with anemia. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, to shorten maturation time, and to cause early release of reticulocytes. Other factors that affect erythropoiesis are the supply of nutrients (eg, iron, folate, or vitamin B12) and cell-cell interactions between erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, and other components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Factors that may suppress erythropoiesis include chronic debilitating diseases and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism or hyperestrogenism).

They feed on the blood of other mammals. In some species, both male and female mosquitoes feed on blood but the males generally feed only on the nectar and juices of plants. Female mosquitoes feed on blood to generate enough protein in their bodies to lay eggs.

This is why it makes me so mad to be a woman!!!!!\nFortunately we are not all like this! (just 98% of us)\nScrew all this crap where these chicks are saying money equals security and blah blah blah. \nWhen they find out you have money they see things like shopping, spas, expensive resturants, diamonds, big houses and gifts flowing til no end.\nMoney shouldn't mean anything to a woman if she is actually into YOU and not your bank account. \nNext time a girl shows no interest in you and than changes because they know you have money do this:them that you changed your mind because you would rather not be involved with a gold digger just as she would rather not be involved with a guy with a normal bank account. Than tell her your gonna go buy a big screen and laugh. \nIf you really wanna meet an actual nice woman (we do exsist in small numbers) than never disclose how much money you make until the realtionship is established.\nGood luck..\nI'm sorry most of us are b*tches.

first off Pauly Hun...you have issues you seem to want to jump around like angry Brit at the first sight of misunderstanding....I think that u have a low self esteem. I am not going to sit here and call you an idiot or a jerk i think its deeper than that...Do u realize what ur prejudice does to our world? to our children that grow up and hear their parents call other country's names....they grow up bombing Church's with children in them....running planes into building. Are you raising future suicide bomber?I understand u may not understand the country..but dont let ur hate control ur common sense. where does it get u to call names...are you a 6 yr old that got his ball taken away? I dont think so...GROW UP!!!!!!......By the way just checked out some of ur questions u have a real problem u may want to think about getting some help...I dont think you realize the poison ur spreading with ur words...I hope that u dont have children....and if u do they should be taken away...teaching ur children such hate is child abuse.
The best diets are low fat and low carb.\nYour problem is not getting enough exercise.\nMost Americans just want to lose weight instead of wanting to be healthy. You have to exercise for one hour every day and eat right. Stop whining about how you can't keep with a diet. It's your fault you are failing. You have to make a decision to eat right and exercise and then stick with it. You want it to be easy so here's the trick. Eat right and exercise. Its that simple. Take control and stop whining about why you fail. If you don't you will NEVER be healthy and you will never lose weight.

Pope Leo must have hated the Reformation and Martin Luther. He was born a Medici and got the church way into debt. As a result, he decided to sell 'indulgences' or forgiveness for sin. Martin Luther called him and the church on this as well as many other things. He was called out and had no where to hide. That's enough reason, don't you think?

Chinese is more difficult, but it's more helpful. Many Asian languages including Japanese and Korean are derived from Chinese. So if you can write Chinese, even educated Japanese and Koreans can understand you. Don't learn simplified Chinese for 2 reasons. 1) only people in China can read it and 2) it's incredibly ugly, and disrupts the traditional calligraphy of the characters.

First, you need to know whether or not your notebook has integrated wireless. If it does, great. Go to the linksys website and let it automatically detect your wireless card and give you a list of compatible software. After that, you can generally do this:\n\nControl Panel -> Network Connections -> Right click on your wireless connection -> Wireless Networks tab -> click to have Windows automatically configure your wireless settings.\n\nThen you should open a browser and connect to your router to configure your wireless settings in your router. Most use Linksys, so if you do, just type http://192.168.1.1 and go.\nThen if you hadn't set your password in it, it defaults to admin/admin. Feel free to change your settings to any secure password you feel like, and apply this password to the wireless connection as soon as your wireless network card picks it up. After that, reboot the router and your notebook, and you should be able to connect.\n\nIf you're still experiencing problems, then you might have conflicting devices. Use device manager to rule this out. Also, connecting to another network not your own is not the best answer. It doesn't provide you with the necessary security while on the internet. If all else fails, call tech support and allow them to help you. :)

Believe me that is an age old problem and a rough one too.\nIf you give her an ultimatum…well he’s there and you’re not. On the other hand if you just keep putting you best foot forward. Keep precise notes, always remember her birthday, all the anniversaries (the day you first wrote her and her you, fist met, anything and everything), don’t forget birthdays valentines day and whatever else you can think of to give you that upper edge. \nYou know every now and then you could send her flowers “Just to say I love you.” Women love that stuff.\nThere is something else to consider: She isn’t that exactly that tight with the other guy if she is interested in you, which is a point in your favor.\nRemember though when you talk to her carefully, very carefully try to find out where you stand. If you think, and can confirm that you are falling way behind then dump her, on your terms. \nI have been there twice myself I found out that one was after my money and the other was married.

Planck was one of the people who was thinking of energy as being delivered in discrete amounts or bundles. This was one of the clues that lead Einstein to conclude in his 'Photo-electric Effect' experiments that, again, energy was being absorbed at only very specific frequencies and possibly in specific bundles of energy.\n\nThen you get to thinking of light as photons to carry the energy and materials seem to only absorb special kinds of bundles of energy and some guys in Stockholm start thinking that energy changes in atoms occur in discrete quanta. Neils Bohr and friends were trying to come up with equations to describe the orbit of the electron around the nucleus and put some of the Planck stuff together with the Einstein stuff and came up with the idea that electrons could only change orbits according to the energy quanta that they absorbed and emitted.\n\nFrom all this we get the basics of quantum mechanics, sub-atomic orbital mechanics, lasers, fluorescent lights, bunches of stuff :).
I still love Hendrix, I will never get tired of the Band of Gypsies from New Years Eve 1969. Some of the most brilliant Hendrix guitar playing ever. ZZ Top always makes me smile although I don't listen that much anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have most of their older albums. Led Zeppelin was brilliant, I loved Zeppelin I, II, and IV the most. I need to break some out since you made me think of it. Pink Floyd did some things that I just loved, "Shine on You Crazy Diamond", "Dark Side of the Moon", "The Wall", great albums, genius. I was a Hendrix freak when I was younger, then I was exposed to the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia. So much of that music is so poignant and relevant to me and the way I experience life. I think it will be something in my life forever. In fact, I have had that same thought, about my funeral. I have a couple of Grateful Dead songs I want played. If you are familiar, I am going to have "Brokedown Palace" played. It almost makes me cry every time I hear it, a very beautiful piece. I also want to have "Sing Me Back Home" played too. I know it isn't a Dead original, but I just love to hear Jerry's voice on songs like that. I have decided to go back to school for a career change and I am there every day with a bunch of 18-19 year old kids. Most have no idea what any of that music sounds like. All they know is hip hop rap or death metal. I often ask myself if I too am a dinosaur. I'm right there with you.

Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.

High doses of Vitamin B6 (300 milligrams or more per day) for long periods of time (greater than 6 months) in a few people has caused peripheral neuropathy.\n\n100 mg/day is considered safe. I do not know why your doctor is recommending B6 for the treatment of your chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. I just did a 'quick' search of Pubmed (where the world's medical research can be reviewed) and found several studies showing the supplement Acetyl-L-Carnitine may be effective for the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies. This might be a better 'bet' than B6.\n\nYou can read these studies by going to Pubmed (enter 'entrez pubmed' in your search engine). In the search window of Pubmed enter: 'chemotherapy peripheral neuropathy Acetyl-L-Carnitine'. You may want to share these studies with your doctor.\n\nBest wishes and good luck.

Wow. You would think a "cheeky" question would generate more answers. I grew up in the USA, so I'm not even positive what "cheeky" is. \n\nSelf confidence is a different matter. I suppose any number of self-help books and techniques could help you there.\n\nBut I think first of all, you need to be yourself. That way you will attract friends who like you. If you act cheeky and self confident, and feel otherwise, you will attract people you would rather not spend time with.\n\nHowever, that wasn't your question. \n\nOkay, I just looked up cheeky: Impertinently bold; impudent and saucy. I would say read cheeky material, hang out with cheeky friends, and it's bound to rub off. \n\nAs for self confident: showing poise and confidence in your own worth...it doesn't seem to be a synonym for cheeky. \n\nCheeky seems to hinge on a disregard for accepted measurements of society. Self confidence seems to require an understanding of accepted forms of evaluating an individual.\n\nPerhaps you could be a poised, polite, person...who is bold (cheeky) about facing life's hardships, but humble and self confident, when dealing with relationships.\n\n...you know, someone who faces life sarcastically, but treats people with serious consideration...\n\nNow that sounds like someone I could be friends with.

First off, I read that the question was about an upset stomach, not about cramps. Cramps is a completely different thing.\n\nMenstrual cramps are pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen just before or during a menstrual period. Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for menstrual cramps. \n\nAn upset stomach is just that. The symptoms of an upset stomach include occasional heartburn, indigestion, a taste of bile in the mouth, pains in the stomach, nausea and then there is Gastritis - meaning inflammation of the stomach.\n \nWhen you menstruate your hormones can over-stimulate the emesis centers of the brainstem resulting in frequent upset stomach. In pregnancy this is known as "morning sickness", this uncomfortable problem tends to be worse when you first wake up, but can happen any time of the day. Try eating crackers or smaller, more frequent meals. Try to keep track of what you eat and see if a particular food might be causing it. Some of the "troublesome foods are coffee, citrus fruits, fatty foods, spicy foods, onions, alcohol and chocolate.

Every woman is different, but you should be able to still breastfeed. As soon as your baby is born iniate skin to skin contact and ask the midwife to help you breastfeed, the sooner you commence breastfeeding the better, even if baby only has a few sucks it all helps to stimulate the production of milk, try not to have pethidine in labour as this can make your baby sleepy in the first 24 hours. Your consultant will probably tell you that you can't breastfeed, but remember they tend to deal with general surgery and not midwifery. Most hospitals in the UK have breast feeding advisors that you can talk to before your baby is born.

The man of lawlessness is one who comes to do away with the law. Daniel 7:25 says that he will "try to change times and laws". This person will probably attempt to replace the Biblical times and holidays, attempting to do away with Pesach (Passover), change the time the day begins from the biblical method of starting at evening (perhaps changing it to "the witching hour").\n\nAnd this person will say the law is done away with. This person will deceive if possible even the elect. Something to watch for.

The price probably won't get that high.\n\n1) Eventually Iraq's oil infrastructure will be up and running, which will cushion the market.\n\n2) Demand has to level off eventually. There just isn't enough capital to sustain prices even where they are now. People will have to find ways to conserve/alternate energy. That will mean prices level off.\n\n3) The big dogs like US, PRC, and Russia have enough soft power to lean on OPEC nations to increase production. They don't have to invade, they just have to threaten them with embargos and the like.\n\nEven if those three things don't do the trick, invasion won't actually help much. It's cheaper to pay the Saudi royal family a cut off the top than to subdue a bunch of very irritated Arabs wish kalashnikovs and plastic explosive.

I would agree that there is a certain unfairness about having different-sized divisions, for the reasons you stated. However, both the AL and NL have to have a even number of teams for scheduling purposes. If things were evened out and both leagues had 15 - 3 divisions of 5 - then either there would have to be an interleague game every day, instead of at certain periods of the year, or one team in each league would have to be idle for a day or more likely 3 days at a stretch - the equivalent of scheduling a series against a null team.\n\nThe only ways to fix it would be to either go back to the old divisional set up - two 8-team divisions in the NL and two 7-team divisions in the AL, or expand the AL by two teams, so that both leagues have 16, and go to four 4-team divisions.

because of the rules of taekwondo \n\nin taekwondo competition you are allowed only to punch the torso not to punch face, but to kick torso and face of the opponent \n\nstill , you can get point by punching the torso , but another thing ; the opponent puts a thick gear at his torso , so punching it wont get points , regarding that a point is count only when the hit make a big effect on opponent that could be seen (it move him) or heared (the sound of the hit) and that is the thierd reason , because when you punch that thick gear (called hugo) your punch wont affect him and wont make a sound , so judgs would never mark a point to you from a punch . but when you kick the torso , the leg is big and heavy , do it move the opponent and affects him hard and hugo makes big smash sound from the bare leg kick , so judgs mark a point . also leg is available to kick the face , which you can't do with your hand by the tkd rules , of course kicking the face hurts and many times gets KO \n\nso if you are a taekwondo instructor , or player , would you bother yourself by training punchs ?

Before the "fingerprint" analysis, the DNA must be sampled and stored properly. Even blood or semen that has soaked into a rug or dried in the sunlight can be a source for sample cells. An analysis can be done from as few as 100 cells but requires several steps:\n\n\nScientists extract DNA from the cells.\n\nRestriction enzymes cut the DNA into pieces of various sizes.\n\nGel electrophoresis separates pieces by size.\n\nSeparated pieces are transferred to a nylon membrane, and some sequences are labeled with a radioactive substance called a probe.\n\nX-ray film is exposed by the radioactive emissions of only the labeled sequences. The developed film, called an autorad, shows the familiar track pattern of a DNA profile. \n\n\nCheck OJ Simson case, DNA Fingerprinting was used

In addition to what the other posters have said, it IS possible that your power supply is still bad. Sometimes, they fizzle out and supply some power, but not the full load. I had this happen with one of my machines a year ago. \n\nYou can buy a tester for about 10-15 bucks to see if it is producing the correct power. It's a good investment to have. It's the cheapest thing to troubleshoot. Also, since you mentioned there were storms, that's often the first thing to go, aside from the board itself. Did you smell anything "burnt?" Assuming that is fine, I'd assume it was a board/cpu issue. \n\nSince you already pulled all the peripherals and didn't get any "beeps" from taking out your ram entirely, either the psu isn't giving enough power to the board to GIVE beeps (especially since none of your drives powered up at all) or your bios isn't working enough to care and your board got fried (maybe taking your cpu with it).\n\nBefore running out and buying ram, a new board, a new cpu and all that, try the tester. You can also take it to a shop to have it tested. If you can't find one, a new psu is still the cheapest option to replace if you've got to start buying components. Just make sure to get one with equal or higher wattage or you might not have enough power to juice up all the components you have.\n\nCheck and see if any friends have a similar wattage psu. Maybe you can swap theirs in for a minute and see what happens. Also, for future protection, make sure you use a surge protector on ALL components that run into your machine, including the phone line on your modem. Some people even reccommend replacing them every year. Best of luck to you!

Your diet is the main thing. to get to your abs you need the fat off of them. eat low fat foods and do at least a half hour of cardio a day to burn fat. after that different excercises target different areas. the best excercise i've found to work your whole abdominal area is to get a large excercise ball and get in push-up position with your ankles on the ball. pull your legs up to your chest and stretch back to push-up position. you will have to work up to higher repititions as you go because it will hurt you at first. work up to five sets of twenty five reps. leg throws are also really good. lay on your back and have somebody stand at your feet. raise your legs up to the other persons waist or chest and have them throw them back down. you have to raise your legs back up without letting them touch the floor. work up to five sets of twenty five with those also
Ninoguapo also didn't use a spell-checker!\n\nThe answer is 702. Here's how to get the answer.\n\nThe other way to say what this question is asking is this: If the school is 45% boys and 55% girls (which we know), then that means that the 858 girls are 55% of the total number in the school.\n\n"But," you say, "55% of WHAT????"\n\nYou can compare it using a ratio: 858 over "some magical unknown number" is the same as 55 over 100. So MULTIPLY 858 by 100, and then divide the answer by 55. That means the "magical unknown number" turns out to be 1,560...that's how many students there are in the school.\n\nTake out the girls (858) from the total (1,560) and you get...702. That's 45% of 1,560.

You could contact a logo company...you should be able to find one cheap in your area with a simple web search. Make sure you specify that the logo be submitted in color in b&w (some logos which look great in one are barely readable in others). Don't pick one that is too trendy, as it may look great now, but will look silly in 10 years. And negotiate in advance to get the logo from the designer in a "vector" format for future use, as vector images are easily scalable to print large items like billboards, and also negotiate the rights for future use without royalties.

Well, I'll try to be clear. Yes, it's semen (and only it!)\nThat event is called male orgasm and it occurs when the excitment reaches the apex. Mind sends signal and from Prostate and Testicles (and from other glans too) semen begins to come out (through the urethra). It's a fast event lasting few seconds even. And after 1 -2 min. penis become flabby again. I hope to have satisfied your question.

I think you are right, no matter how interesting their conversation may have been, your friend should have had the courtesy to stop for a moment to introduce you as you were together since the beginning, however as a demonstration of education it would be acceptable that you waited for the perfect moment during their conversation to introduce yourself with a positive comment emphasizing the good aspect of making new friends or simply encouraging their conversation. \n\nHaving manners often implies having empathy with others.
Yes. do something for him. whatever you planned. Maybe he is just really good at surprises. Lets hope so! But..... If he really didn't do anything for you then you need to kick him to the curb! It is Valentines Day !! the day for lovers. If he didn't think enough of you to do something then he is lazy and not worth your time and effort! I bet he takes you for granted in other areas, right?? I bet you are the one that is holding up the relationship. I bet this is not the first time he dissed you. Hope for the best -- expect a big surprise -- but also be ready to kick him to the curb! Respect youself or he never will.
I'm not a fan of Suicide Girls. The models are not paid and the site owners are profiting big time. Meanwhile, these women are left with their half-naked bodies plastered on the internet and nothing to show for it but Suicide Girls underwear and a membership. That, I think, is degrading to an extent. \n\nBesides that, I don't feel nude modeling is wrong. It's a woman's choice if she would like to remove her clothing for the camera. Why be ashamed of your body?

A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint.\n\nCartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin.

This could possibly be a parotid tumor. Don't be afraid- they are usually benign, although it is a good idea to get them checked out. I had one for a couple of years. Several doctors said it was a swollen gland, but it grew until it was bothering me. I was sent to an ENT who did a CT , found out it was a parotid tumor, and took it out. No problems, and barely a scar.

I think this is true. Whenever Kobe score 50 points he also has more than 10 turnovers by himself. Although hes hot most of the time when hes not he wont stop shooting until he starts making them. When you look at the 3 games that the Lakers have won against the Suns you notice that in two of those games Kobe wasnt the highest score and in the other game Kobe was the leading score by just a few points. If he does not pass the ball and wants to be the hero of the game his team is gonna lose. Hes gonna have to make more than 50 points in order to win the game. For example when he scored 62 against the Mavericks and 81 against the Toronto Raptors. But how likely is that gonna happen? The Lakers should lose game 7 against the Suns because Kobe is gonna be on edge with Barbosa back and hes prolly gonna wanna show off and score a bunch of points. The only way I see the Lakers winning is if Kobe scores way more than 50 points. If he makes 40 or more than the Suns are going to the second round of the playoffs.

How long have you been with him? Some guys will hang around for months trying to get in your pants, especially if they know it will be your first time. If he is pressuring you for sex, you may need to consider what others are saying. Take some time away from him and see what happens. Don't give in to him until you feel sure of what is going on with the relationship.

You can and will get over OCD . I have suffered from Obessive compulsive disorder from age 4 to 21 It was awful and ruined my childhood and teenage life. Then No one even knew what it was. It has become out in the open lately and there is all kind of help for it. I mean I had it super bad washing hands over and over having to do things over and over trying to control the unwanted thoughts it was hell so I sympathize with you< But when I tell you it can be controlled believe me I lived it and camr thru the other side.. In my case I simply had enough of it surrendered to it. asked god to remove it trusted that god would and did not do the compulsion no matter how bad I wanted to I believed god would not allow the unwanted thought to happen if I trusted god and didnt do the compulsion it was hard at first but I just didnt do it no matter whqt and thank God for removing it as if it already happened!!!!! Eventually it did and I am 40 now and Have had a good adult life OCD free !!!! There is medication now that controls it and therepy 2 So it will be easier for you but I am telling you dont let it win. You control you mind remember that !!!!!!!!

And many employers will pay for you to continue your education so the continuing classes will be free.

Between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics??\n\nIsn't one of the main differences that most Roman Catholic priests are not married and most Eastern Orthodox priests are permitted to marry? -- I think that "would affect family life".\n\nAnother difference ... Roman Catholics acknowledge the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff; Eastern Orthodox do not.\n\nSimilarities include, I think, that they all believe in transubstantiation.

It sounds like he already likes you, if you go off of what he did at the basketball game. One of you needs to make a move now, before it loses momentum and *gets weird*.\n\nTips to avoid *getting weird* while getting your point across:\n\n1. Try not to be too serious about it, no matter how you feel inside. Laughter is a great tension-breaker.\n2. Don't bring it up when there are other distractions around.\n3. Bring it up like you both know where the relationship is going. Because you both do. Don't play dumb about it.\n\nAnd that's it, really. It will work. We have a tendency to make these things bigger in our heads, then we look back and see that it was a small step instead of a large leap. Just give up, surrender...and do it.

Prices in OC are increasing, but the volume of home sales is down. In November I bought a condo that was listed for 2 days, now 3 in my complex have been on the market for over 45 days. \n\nHowever the place I bought was listed $50,000 less then the same model listed by another agent. By the time the bidding war was over I paid $10K more then the asking price, the other unit for sale was thrashed and sold a month after mine for $5000 less then I paid. Best way to sell quick is to price VERY LOW, it will get the attention of all buyers looking in your area. You dont have to accept full price offers. If you have a good agent they will bluff any single offers. I have no way of verifying there was ever a bidding war on my condo, just that the sellers agent says he had 3 full price offers. My mom was my realtor, I had 20% down payment, no home to sell, no contingencies, and I worked for a loan company. I also put a $20,000 deposit. In all actuality I doubt a better buyer was making an offer. \n\nRates are going up and people will spend more to borrow the same amount, lowering the amount they can afford. If a lot of renters occupy your condo complex it may prove a good time to sell. The owners of rental properties will let investment properties go into foreclosure before they let a primary residence default. \nAre you moving up, or relocating? Do you owe alot or have equity in your home? The market is stable, but I know alot of people in over thier heads. I also know a lot of investors with huge amounts of money to snatch up any real deals.
Research shows that metabolic rate is 4 - 5% lower in those people who do not have this meal, and therefore even with a low calorie intake you will relatively have less chance of losing weight than someone who eats the same calories but has some of those at breakfast time.\nThat's because the breakfast meal acts as a kick start to the metabolism for the rest of the day.\nYou should ensure ensure that you use the mind and your brain sensibly.\nOne classical thing to do is to remove temptation.\nFor instance if you eat as a family you may be used to having serving dishes and having 'just one more spoonful' whilst eating from the serving dish.\nRather than having to stop temptation simply remove temptation by serving on individual plates.\nIn addition try to gradually reduce portion size a little, if done over time you and your body will adjust and losing weight in a sustainable way will be easier to achieve.To approach a diet in the best possible way, you need to be realistic up front about what you will achieve.\nNothing demotivates more than setting really hard targets and not meeting them.\nSome will set a sweeping target such as losing a stone in a few weeks or something else that is just impossible to obtain at least in a healthy way and then give up on the diet disillusioned.\nTherefore you should be sure to set ultra realistic targets at least at the start. When you meet them you will be encouraged. Set small, realistic targets often for the best chance of diet success and continued motivation during the course of your diet.These days, dieting is all the rage. The companies that make the products and books make billions of pounds and dollars a year - it's a massive industry. Which means only one thing - they want it to sound really hard to lose weight, so as you buy their products. But that's where you can go wrong.\nThere is one simple truth to losing weight that you don't need a book to tell you, but it's the only one that matters. If you take in less than you use, there is no way that can gain weight - in fact you will lose weight. All this talk of Atkins Diets and eating no carbohydrate (which is not at all healthy) is not relevant.\nThe two golden rules of losing weight are so breathtakingly simple, yet people spend thousands on expensive dieting videos, expensive diet foods and all sorts.\n(1) You must do decent amounts of exercise. If you can introduce 30 minutes exercise into your daily routine, whether this be a brisk walk, perhaps a swim at lunchtime or a jog at the weekend, and eat the same amount as you always have, after 6 weeks the results will be breathtaking. Not only will you lose weight, you will also feel fantastic.\n(2) Cut out the snacks. If you look at most people's meals, who are not happy with their weight, it's just not true that they are eating meals full of calories. In fact if you just add up their main meals it often adds up to less than the daily calorie limits. So where does it go wrong? SNACKS!!! It's been shown time and again that all the snacking through the day vastly increases the amount of calories that people take in - a bag of crisps here, a chocolate bar there - and before you know it you've added another 1,000 calories to your day's intake.\nSo the second rule is simple - continue to eat your main meals and drinks, breakfast, lunch and dinner. But stop the snacking. You could save as much as 1,000 calories a day like this. It's only when you stop snacking that you probably will realise how often you do snack without realising it. So stay disciplined - you get three lovely meals a day, just cut out the snacking OK?\nIf you follow these two recommendations above for six weeks, you will feel great and have lost weight. And because it is not at all a punishing program, with points or starving or deprivation of certain food types (how could that be healthy?) you will be able to maintain this program long term without too much difficult

Selfishness. Everyone seems to want things fixed or changed but expects others to do it for them, or wonders why there is even a problem to begin with, not thinking or realizing they are part of the problem. It takes effort, caring, time, and selfless acts to change things. Just think what it took to change the British taxes ( the Boston Tea Party) Now that took a lot of self-deprivation and effort by a lot of people. I don't see that same thing in people today.\nIt would take another revolution to change things.

No doubt that both fantastic players.\n\nHernan Crespo is a typical penalty box striker and there are not too many players who play this position better than the Argentine striker.\n\nCarlos "Carlito" Teves is an altogether different type of striker, he plays in a role similar to Wayne Rooney and links the midfield play to the attack.\n\nCrespo has still got what it takes , But Teves is is only going to get better.\nFor me Teves just wins it.\n\nBut the debate about the best Argentine player at the moment has to be between the FANTASTIC Juan Roman Riquelme and the BOY WONDER Lionel Messi

yes you do have an aura and although you may not be able to see it yourself sometimes you should be able to feel it.if you imagine it to be similar to a mood ring where they change colour in perception to the way you are feeling then try visualising a glow around you depending on how you are feeling. this is your aura and it appears naturally which more than most can see. although its not just dependant on your mood you also have a natural aura which you will have to ask somebody who can see it what shade it is then you can get a better explanatio hope this helps xxx

Abscence of thought is pure peace of mind. There is no other feeling quite like it. \n I believe with a great deal of practice that you can control your thought pattern, so that no thought enters it for a short period. It is not easy, especially with the possibility of distraction. But it can be done and it centers you, you will feel more energy, having clearer thought process and many other benefits. This has been said to be a religion of sorts but that is not how I ever used it, I would use to just relax for myself not to give money to someone for a word to repeat to get to that state. Find one word , preferably single syllable and use that as your mantra. It usually has a meaning special only to you and how can anyone tell you that.\nYou can slow down if not totally end the thought process for a short time with practice. It does not work for all but for some its a blessing.

The source of the auroras is the sun. The sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 200 to 440 miles per second. A "cloud" or gas of such ions and electrons is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the fringes of the earth's magnetic field, the particles are "shocked" into flowing around the earth. Some of the particles are trapped by the earth's magnetic field. They follow the magnetic lines of force down to the ionosphere. The particles strike the gases in the ionosphere, causing them to glow, the same way electrons passing through the gases in a neon tube make a neon sign light up. The colors correspond to the different gases in the ionosphere. Oxygen atoms give off red and green light, depending on how high they are in the ionosphere. Nitrogen molecules give off blue and violet light.

Try networking at your local Chamber of Commerce. They often have networking breakfasts or lunches.\n\nRE: FSBO's - Do you want to purchase these homes? Ask for information like #bed #bath sqft etc. Just think what you care about in your own home. Recent updates to major appliances, carpet, roof, heat/air, etc. Any title problems, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc. (Owner's sometimes get sticky regarding their personal finances, and might not appreciate too much inquiry.)\n\nTry calling a mortgage company to find out what you would need to buy the house. Do you want an interest only loan, are you going to need an appraisal, survey, flood insurance, pre-payment penalties, etc. If you plan on flipping houses and need financing, a good loan officer will take time to help with most questions.
In Dentistry, we try to save a tooth if possible. Extraction is the last resort (if a patient is willing to try other routes, as you have done). Sometimes, even with the best Dentist and the best intentions, a tooth is nonrestorable. Ideally, you should have had a crown on this tooth right after the root canal, (was this done/recommended) this is a way to avoid loosing more strucure. If a tooth is broken or decayed below the gum line it typically cant be saved. I cant say for sure what I would do if you were my patient as I do not know the entire history and cant see your tooth. If you fear you are being told this because for some reason this dentist can't fix your tooth or just doesnt want to for some reason, I would recommend a second opinion. Find a friend who is happy with their dentist and make an appointment for a consultation regarding this tooth. GOOD LUCK!
They don't make it harder for Eastern Europeans than many other nations, but some few nations (including much of Western Europe) DO have an easier access. This is based upon the risk of visa violations. It is believed that residents of Norway, for example, are much less likely to overstay their visas than a resident of Bosnia, for example. But it isn't specific to Eastern Europe. Most of the world falls into the same category.

If it's for research that has to be approved by an Institutional Review Board, they will require that you get permission before they approve the proposal. And I think permission might be hard to get. Chain of command, all that jazz. Plus any parents that get wind of it might them boycott the store over feelings of an invasion of privacy.\n\nOther than that, I think it depends on your gender. I mean, it's a toy store. A man lurking in a toy store for three hours looks like a pedophile shopping for victims and might get arrested. A woman isn't nearly as suspicious-looking.\n\nIf you're not going to ask, don't let them catch you taking notes or you might get thrown out. Again, looks very criminal. Stay away from the register, be prepared to pretend you're shopping for holiday presents, and carry as small and unobtrusive a notebook as possible.

Dragnet-1954 it was ,Sgt. Joe Friday played by Jack Webb.\n\nIn the 1952-59 series, viewers never saw the crime being committed. "Dragnet" was a mystery program; Sgt. Friday and Officer Smith would be called in to solve a crime, then locate and arrest the guilty party/parties. (As Webb put it, "This makes YOU a cop, and you unwind the story.") "Dragnet" (1954) begins with the actual crime, so that we KNOW who's guilty even before the titles appear.

Cohens v. Virginia \nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264 (1821), was a United States Supreme Court decision most noted for the Marshall Court's assertion of its power to review state supreme court decisions in criminal law matters. The Court had previously asserted a similar jurisdiction over civil cases in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816).\n\nIn this case, the Cohens were prosecuted successfully by the state of Virginia for selling lottery tickets from the District of Columbia in Virginia, thereby violating Virginia state law. The Supreme Court upheld their convictions.\n\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases \n\nReferences\nJean Edward Smith, John Marshall: Definer Of A Nation, New York: Henry Holt & Company, 1996. \n\nExternal links\nLII: full text of Cohens v.

several courses of action should be taken.\n\nif there is no alternative to the slope, then you should force the water to go a longer distance, and make the slope smaller, like a down hill skier. reducing the slope and putting in many bends will slow the water down more. \n\nupstream, a retention pond should be put in, or a sizable pool that will fill with water, slow down the water, and really delay the water form heading downstream all at once. although if you have monsoons, this may not have maximum effect.\n\nduring the dry season, plant in the streambed and beside it where the water goes. try to use plants that are typically in or near the water or the stream. this will slow the water down, and the roots will help hold onto soil to keep it from washing away.\n\nafter these options, a small dam could be put in. start by placing wooden or metal poles in a line, slightly bowed out going upstream, across the stream bed. from there, place wooden or metal poles laid down across the perpendicular poles. then place the soil on top of that. in the middle of the dam, you will want it open in a v shape going up the dam, to allow water to still pass through. a v shape will allow the little bit of water to pass when it is dryer, but more to pass when it is wetter. ideally you should put a layer of concrete over the dam to stop it from eroding, but if not, then just pack it very tightly and put more plants right into the dam.\n\nthough some of this sounds expensive and time consuming, will save in the end if you dont have to truck in the sand.\n\n\n\nif its part of a road, use cement/ brick/ mudbricks over the section that water flows on. if its a short section, see if it would be possible to install a culvert (pipe) so that water will flow under and not over the road.\n\nwithout additional information, i can only suggest rocks and boulders in the area to slow the water and prevent erosion. other techniques that you can research that are more specific to your situation may be found on a yahoo search, or if you have some money, invite an engineer (geotechnical or civil) to the site if possible.

There are steps that you can take to break your lease because of the situation, but the situation itself doesn't automatically release you from your lease.\n\nLook up the procedure in your state for a constructive eviction. There are notice requirements and the landlord has to be given an opportunity to correct the situation. Notice requirements are determined by the state, and your having "complained" a few times may not qualify. \n\nYou will probably have to send a certified letter, wait a period of time (10 days, 2 weeks, etc) for action to be taken and then if the situation still has not improved you can break your lease without penalty.\n\nSome landlords do challenge constructive eviction claims. If they do, you will need a lawyer at that point.

I'd assume you have 4 more months to train, but that should be a good amount of time. Gradually increase you average distance and don't run the same amount everyday obviously. Do a couple of 10 mile days and then on one day run 15. This'll get you used to suddenly running a lot because it'd obviously be torture on your body to run 26 miles everyday. But you could do that once in a while during your training, it'd be a good idea.
A menu like that pops up when you click the RIGHT button under normal circumstances. What happens when you click the button on the right side? Does your icon turn blue? If you double-click the right button, does IE open up?\n\nIf so, you can fix this by going into your computer's Control Panel. Click on START and Control Panel should be on the right-hand side of the menu (if not, click on START using the other mouse button).\n\nFrom here, it depends on your operating system. You might see an icon called "mouse", or you might see "printers and other hardware" - if so, click this, and then you'll see one called "mouse". Double click "mouse". Move to the "properties" tab if you are not already there. Then under "button configuration", see if the box before "switch primary and secondary buttons" is checked. If it is, uncheck this box, and it should return everything to normal.\n\nIf this doesn't help, I would go to the Website of the company who manufactured your mouse. They usually have tips for troubleshooting problems like yours.\n\nI hope this helps. Try it and see.

hi there\ni am very allergic to blueberries. I get horrible stomachaches and a rash as well. the best thing to do, well, really the only thing to do is to avoid them alltogether. it sucks if you like them, but if you want to avoid the stomache pains, you'll have to give them up. also, you may want to talk to your doctor or be referred to an allergist for a test to see if you may be allergic to anything else.\nit also may be a food sensitivity or intolerance rather than an allergy. the outcome is still the same, you'll still have to stop eating them. hope this helps you

You have to be careful. Strong correlation does not necessarily prove a causal connection. I remember a letter to the London Times in the 1970's where a Cambridge undegraduate took a leading economist to task. The economist had found a strong correlation between the amount of money in circulation and inflation, he concluded that a large amount of money in circulation caused inflation. The undergraduate found a higher correlation between the incidence of dissentry in Scotland and inflation. He claimed therefore that dissentry was the cause of inflation. What they both had found was two increasing series of numbers. Unless you can explain the mechanism by which the two series are contected then proced with your hypothesis with caution. Don't bet your last dollar until you see whether your predictor works for a reasonable time, and then be cautious because unless you can explain the conection the circumstances may very well have changed since you original data was collected

The men of the NBA are among the highest paid employees on the planet, making an average of almost $4 million each for the 2004-05 season, according to the Players Union. The women of the WNBA, on the other hand, earned on average between $46,000 (says the union) and $60,000 for the season (says the league). \n\nIt certainly seems unfair that WNBA MVP Lauren Jackson can make a maximum of $87,000 per year (according to the latest collective bargaining agreement), while perennial NBA disappointment Shawn Bradley is guaranteed a minimum of $1,100,000. But consider the following: average NBA attendance is about 17,000 per game, while the WNBA brings in 10,000. The average NBA ticket price is over $45, the WNBA just $15. \n\nThen of course, there's the TV money. And in last year's contract dispute that delayed the start of the woman's season, the league claimed it had never turned a profit. While many WNBA players said they were disappointed with the final agreement, they did gain some new benefits, including the right of free agency and a less restrictive list of products they can endorse. \n\nStill, with NBA yearly salaries ranging as high as a whopping $28 million for Kevin Garnett in 2003, some may feel compelled to sign a petition urging the WNBA to cough up a little more dough for the ladies. \n\nHere's some WNBA player salary and contract info from 2004:\n\nJune, 2004: The minimum WNBA salary for players with 0-3 years of experience is $30,600 and for players with 4 or more years of experience it's $43,700. The maximum WNBA salary is $87,000. 2004 WNBA Rookies make somewhere between $41,000 and $34,000. Players on the team that wins the WNBA championship each get a bonus of $10,000. Players on the runner-up team each get $5,000.\n\nWNBA SALARY CAP\n\nJune, 2004: The 2004 WNBA team salary cap is $647,000. For 2005, it'll be $673,000. For 2006 it'll be $700,000. If the WNBA collective bargaining agreement is extended, then for 2007 the WNBA salary cap will be $728,000.\n\nJune, 2004: The WNBA minimum team salary cap is 90% of the salary cap.
This is his third season as manager, his seventh year since finishing a one-year jail sentence. He came to Bridgeport as a player, looking for a second chance. He had lost his wife and several years of his life -- he'd last appeared in the majors in 1995 with the California Angels -- but he discovered a team, and a league, desperate for players with recognizable names.\n\n"We had some concern about whether he would really work out for us," Bridgeport owner and founder Mickey Herbert said. "But, from the time he came in here, he was a veteran. We were really surprised about how he chose to counsel the younger ballplayers, especially because, at first, he wasn't in any kind of coaching capacity."\n\nIn February 2003, manager Duffy Dyer left the team. He'd been offered a scouting job with the New York Mets. Suddenly, the Bluefish had Lind, and Lind had a chance he'd never really expected.\n\nMinor league baseball returns to Bridgeport for its eighth season; it’s been a smashing success as part of the city’s renaissance, which includes the arena opened next door.\n\nAn Atlantic League team (independent), the Bridgeport Bluefish play in the 5,300-seat stadium called Harbor Yard, which is a family-friendly, well-staffed and well-maintained operation. The park is between Main and Water streets, just south of I-95 and right near the train station and the ferry slip.\n\nThe Bluefish are managed by Jose “Chico” Lind, a former Golden Glove winner with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The park has a picnic area that groups of 24 to 250 may reserve and the games feature the kind of fan-friendly goings-on between innings that are so cherished in minor league baseball.\n\nGames will start at 7:05 Monday-Saturday, at 1:35 on Sunday. The season gets underway April 28 against Long Island and there will be fireworks every Friday and a host of special promotions including the popular "Sundae Fun Day Run Day." The season continues through mid-September:-)

There are certain kinds of transition lenses nowadays that don't depend on the chemical that the lens is soaked in. They used to call this photo white photo black, for its ability to turn clear and dark under different light conditions. What happens is when light impacts the molecules that make up the lens itself, causing it to become excited at the atomic level. When this happens you have electrons jumping from a ground state to an excited state, and the resultant photon given off is of a certain energy level, which will explain why we even have a choice of colour for our transition lenses. This is largely based on the electromagnetic spectrum. When we go back into a room there is not enough light to continually maintain the higher energy quantization of the atom and it reverts back to its original ground state, a.k.a unexcited state, and it ends up clear.

It is used to limit traffic through the router much in the same way as normal firewall rules.\n\nExample:\naccess-list 100 permit tcp any host 171.16.23.1 eq 80\n\nThis would allow any computer to access a webserver on the computer at IP address 171.16.23.1\n\nThe following Link has alot of good examples.

hey! thanx 4 writing to me. anyway, i think a guy should be dressed nice when he's comin towards a girl to make a good impression, but i dont mean in a tuxedo or anythin like that! just be sure u look nice...and smell nice. and please be funny but i dont mean the lame "knock knock jokes" either. just make her laugh and give her ur # and say she can call anytime and listen to her (at least pretend to listen if shes boring)by nodding ur head and lookin at her. then tell her somethin like "ur nice to hang out with... maybe we should see each other more often". i dunno. but if i were talked to in that way, i would totally like the guy!

Basic Answer \nThe circumference of the Earth at the equator is 25,000 miles. The Earth rotates in about 24 hours. Therefore, if you were to hang above the surface of the Earth at the equator without moving, you would see 25,000 miles pass by in 24 hours, at a speed of 25000/24 or just over 1000 miles per hour. \n\nMultiply by cosine of your latitude to see how fast the Earth is rotating where you are. \n\nEarth is also moving around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour. \n\nAdvanced Answer \n\nIf by "turning" you mean the rotation of the Earth about its axis (where axis just means the straight line between the North and South poles) it is quite easy to figure out how fast any part of the Earth's surface is moving. \n\nThe Earth rotates once in a few minutes under a day (23 hours 56 minutes 04. 09053 seconds). This is called the sidereal period (which means the period relative to stars). The sidereal period is not exactly equal to a day because by the time the Earth has rotated once, it has also moved a little in its orbit around the Sun, so it has to keep rotating for about another 4 minutes before the Sun seems to be back in the same place in the sky that it was in exactly a day before. \n\nAn object on the Earth's equator will travel once around the Earth's circumference (40,075.036 kilometers) each sidereal day. So if you divide that distance by the time taken, you will get the speed. An object at one of the poles has hardly any speed due to the Earth's rotation. (A spot on a rod one centimeter in circumference for example, stuck vertically in the ice exactly at a pole would have a speed of one centimeter per day!). The speed due to rotation at any other point on the Earth can be calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude of the point. (If you are not familiar with cosines, I wouldn't worry about that now, but if you can find a pocket calculator which has a cosine button you might like to try taking the cosine of your own latitude and multiplying that by the rotation speed at the equator to get your own current speed due to rotation!). \n\nThe Earth is doing a lot more than rotating, although that is certainly the motion we notice most, because day follows night as a result. We also orbit the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is about 940 million kilometers, so if you divide that by the hours in a year you will get our orbital speed in kilometers per hour. We are also moving with the Sun around the center of our galaxy and moving with our galaxy as it drifts through intergalactic space!
I searched for "Mennonite Halloween" on line, and came across a few individual congregations that were having youth parties, like other Christian denominations, on Halloween. One group had this to say, and I thought it was a pretty good answer to your question:\n"Many families celebrate Halloween but they often do so by having parties in their homes for children, or church youth groups plan special parties for the evening. There are also Mennonite groups who believe that it is wrong to celebrate Halloween because they believe that it has evil connotations … the celebration of evil spirits, etc. Most conservative groups would not celebrate Halloween because they would consider it foolish and a “worldly” activity. "
Basic idea is that men are less sensitive than women.\n\nSo men are better at heavy physical labor and adverse environments (e.g. hot kitchen of a restaurant). Also men are more comfortable with uncertainty (mainly b/c they do not give a sh*t) e.g. in business management. \n\nWomen are better when attention to detail is needed, or maintaining something in order, or at dealing with people.

Since you asked this question in earth sciences and geology category, I will assume that you are interested in the kind of dust that gets blown around in the wind, and so forth. \nThe great volume of this dust is formed by erosion (water, wind, ice) of soil, lake beds, and rocks. Clay particles are an especially abundant component of dust--because of they can be small enough to be easily picked up by wind. But, dust can also contain anything else of the right size (small, light). USGS analysis of dust samples collected at monitoring stations shows that the African dusts can carry pesticides, heavy metals (such as mercury and arsenic), naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, pollen, insects, miscellaneous organic debris, smoke, and pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi.\nArid environments generate big dust clouds at time because there are not many plants holding the surface down. Africa and the dry parts of China, for example, may generate big plumes of dust. Known dust sources in the SW USA include dry lake (playa) surfaces and their margins, ephemeral drainage areas, poorly vegetated alluvial fans, agricultural fields, military bases, and growing urban and rural areas. \n\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/dust/\nhttp://health.usgs.gov/inhalation/african_dust.html\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/sw/monitor/dust.html
6 points is a DRASTIC increase, and most research shows that retesters often score lower.\n\nWhy does she need to score so much higher? If it is for a school, I'd suggest looking into a school that more appropriately suits her talents and abilities.\n\nHowever, if you and her are intent on increasing it, I'd suggest a program through Kaplan. It is expensive though. If she'll self study, the ACT prep book published by the College Board themselves was very helpful to me.\n\nIf she is not a Junior currently, know that her score will increase. We took an old version of the ACT in my Sophomore year. I got a 28 then. When I took it my Junior year, I got a 34. Obviously, that is a drastic increase. If she is younger, get her studying now. Have her take AP classes to boost her knowledge. Have her take practice tests. Make sure on the real test day, she has gotten adequate sleep and eats a healthy breakfast. Help her feel confident going into the test, and she'll likely do better!\n\nIf she is a Junior currently, she may not be able to boost her score that much, but it will still help to try some study books or programs. Also, most if not all schools will accept the ACT and SAT interchangeably. I personally did worse on the SAT than on the ACT, but I know many people who did better on the SAT. Maybe she could sign up to try to take that.\n\nI hope she gets the results she hopes for, but don't let her beat herself up about it! Whatever your score-14, or 34, she'll end up somewhere good for HER. If her score doesn't accurately reflect her abilities and talents, there are other places on an application to make those clear. Work on helping her write a strong personal statement for instance.\n\nGood luck to both of you!\n-Nicole

Find this under Start->All Programs->Accessories->System tools->Files and Settings Transfer Wizard. This will help you to transfer your files and most of the windows settings. However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.\n\nFollow these steps\n1. Run the wizard in your old computer. If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option. Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\n\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk. Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\n\n3. Start the new computer and run the tool again.

Many people donate their old PCs, but if you're strapped for cash, you could take it to a pawn shop or to a privately owned shop where they will probably refurbish and upgrade it, then sell it for profit. Most likely, any of those options will leave you disappointed with the amount of cash you receive in comparison to what you expect to get.\n\nWhen I tried to sell my PC, it was easily worth over $700, but the guys at CyberXchange only offered a maximum of $300 to $350. Selling it on Ebay actually has better odds. You can expect close to, if not over what your asking price is.

The Tao Te Ching does not translate into live languages well. The concepts are usually too foreign. I do not know why you think that you need a Latin translation, but you will not find one online and I doubt that anyone who could perform this would do justice to the text.\nTranslation is not the changing of a work into the words of another language. It is the transmitting of the concepts of the original into another language. Latin does not have the words to do this adequately.

According to Jeff Nightbyrd, there is testing industry data that taking 4 aspirins a few hours prior to the test might help you. ". . . aspirin interferes with the Syvia [sic] EMIT assay. It seems that aspirin absorbs at the same wavelength that NAD does which is how it interferes with the assay" (Clin Chem 34 (90) 602-606). Two reliable sources have tested aspirin and found it to interfere with the EMIT. In the future they will try to find a way to circumvent this test flaw. Until then, I certainly recommend taking advantage of the situation and using aspirin

Hi Houseman. It is advisable that both you and your new employer notify the USCIS of your change in employment. If everything goes smoothly and you can prove that you have a similar job under the new employer, it shouldn't be required. However there are cases where it helps.\n\neg.\n\nThe USCIS stated in an August 4, 2003 memo that, if a sponsoring employer revokes an approved I-140 petition after the I-485 application has been pending for 180 days or longer, and there is no notification on file that the foreign national is using AC21 portability, the USCIS must then issue a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) the I-485. In order to prevent the USCIS from issuing a NOID, it is generally advisable for the applicant to notify the USCIS of the job change under AC21 as soon as possible. \n\nYou want to make sure you report everything to the USCIS to make sure there is no confusion over your application.

Hi there\n\nThe tests showed things were normal, that's a good thing! Have you had an exam at a gynocologist? You should have an exam and also a pap smear. The pain on your right side could be from the constipation, straining or possibly a pocket in the intestine. You need to drink more water and make sure you eat or drink fruits/juices/veggies that will make you go to the bathroom better. The discomfort in the abdomen may be from not going to the bathroom right. Try drinking a 12 ounce of cranberry juice a day, that will help you alot to go if your not a veggie eater. Any fruits or fruit drinks, natural ones, will help too.

Perhaps you need to have a few people take a look at your resume to give you some feedback. I would also do some mock interviews and see what professionals think about your interviews skills. The best place to find these resources are at a college, specifically technical colleges want you to succeed so they offer these services to you. Another way to practice is go to job fairs, and have different employers take a look at your resume. Hopefully you will be able to figure out if there is something that might be turning employers away so that you can correct it.

None of these answers are remotely close and they seem well..stupid. I am a Muslim woman and I don't feel oppressed at any time. I wear what I wear do to my love and fear of Allaah the Orginator of the Heaven and earth and all that is between them) my Lord. I could care less as to what anyone thinks and I certainly am not doing this with reguards to a man but for my Lord so some of you who answered this question have no idea of what your talking about and are speaking without Knowledge as usual. Don't hate on us because we have respect for ourselves as instilled in us by Allaah to have shame and be pious. Quetioner be carefull of what kinds of Questions with reguards to Islam you post here. News Flash for those of you who don't know why we cover ourself here is an article on that very thing....\n\nVirtues of Hijab (The modest dress of the Muslim woman)\n____________________________________\n\n1. An act of obedience.\nThe hijab is an act of obedience to Allah and to his prophet (pbuh), Allah\nsays in the Qur'an: `It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and\nHis messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in\ntheir decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.' {Surah 33:36}. Allah also said: 'And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their Juyubihinna (ie their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms). {Surah 24:31} Juyubihinna: The respected scholars from As-Salaf As-Saleh (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.\n\n2. The Hijab is IFFAH (Modesty).\nAllah (subhana wa'atala) made the adherence to the hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty. Allah says: 'O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) over their bodies (when outdoors). That is most convenient that they should be known and not molested.' {S33:59} In the above Ayaah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (swt) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that is still better for them to keep their modesty.\n\n3. The hijab is Tahara (Purity)\nAllah (swt) had shown us the hikma (wisdom) behind the legislation of the hijab: `And when you ask them (the Prophet's wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.' {Surah 33:53}The hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by hijab) and thus the prevention of fitna (evil actions is very much manifested. The hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:`Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.' {Surah 33:32}\n\n4. The hijab is a Shield\nThe prophet (pbuh) said: "Allah, Most High, is Heaven, is Ha'yeii (Bashful),Sit'teer (Shielder). He loves Haya' (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)." The Prophet (pbuh) also said: "Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband'

I think that Cleveland is dramatically improving every year. Sure, theyre not there yet, and theyre probably not even making the playoffs this coming season, but they are a team to watch for the future. Theyve got a young, skilled QB, an experienced RB, and a pretty decent coach. They have some holes defensively, but with the work they did this free agency season, and if they come out well in the draft, they could be a team to watch the next few years. I predict that they will win the superbowl with 15 years from now.
Actually, the year was 1996 (they were playing for the Asian Cup), and the one who scored 4 goals was Ali Daei.

The lightning comes first. Lightning is 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun, so the air around it is superheated and expands rapidly, creating almost a vacuum. As the lighning dissapates, the pressure around the area immediately fills the vacuum due to the great pressure gradient. Whenever there is a sudden change in pressure, shock waves are created that make audible sounds. Just as in a gun shot or a balloon popping, the sudden increase and decrease in pressure cause a loud shockwave that can be heard for miles.

Such a good point.\n\nClearly, we're not that safe at all.\n\nI think there was a rush to hire people for homeland security, but they didn't do very much screening of these same people. Yet, if we can't trust the people running homeland security, what's the purpose of even having that department?
War has come our way. Remember 9/11/2001. If that wasn't a declaration of war by Al-Queda, nothing was. For we Australians, the Bali bombings are serving the same purpose.\n\nHowever, it seems that many in the west have forgotten about Osama Bin Laden and his acolytes and don't understand the importance of the war on terror. Homeland security is not enough. We need to pursue a strong position against terrorism.

An at bat only consists of the time you are at the plate and get a hit or get out. Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting .300, you got on base 3 times via a hit and got out 7 times. Now, your on base percentage does factor in walks and times that you are hit by a pitch. Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting 300 and have 4 walks, then your on base percentage is .500. It is .500 because you went to the plate 14 times and got on base 7 of those times (3 hits and 4 walks) - half of the time you went to the plate you got on base.
Its normal to feel that way after heartache. But what happens if you don't do anything? Do you really want to always wonder if you let Mr. Right slip through your fingers? Its ok to love again. If you truly like him and its no just rebounding, go for it! Just date, get time to know this guy. Work on the friendship part. Hold off on intimacy. If he's really into you, he'll want to learn about you, and not just try to get into your pants. If its been a year of dating and he's still there, that is a guy that is interested in you more than sex! And totally sounds like a keeper. He prolly knows you just got hurt. Go slow, but go with him. Don't let the hurt from your ex hold you back. That is giving him control, and I know you don't want that! Hide in your house for a day. Morn that first love that went bad. Then wake up the next day with all of that behind you. Think positive things whenever you start feeling sad. Remind yourself that its just gonna get better. Start living for today, not letting yesterday hold you back.

It is estimated that there are now only around 15,000 jaguars left in the wild and conservation is centring on the establishment of protected ‘National Park’ areas which may serve to reduce the decline of the jaguars natural habitat. In Belize, the government, aided by the WWF, have set aside 150 square miles of rain forest in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Preserve, which currently provides a protected environment for around 200 jaguars, the largest concentration of the wild cats species in the world. The WWF are also providing aid to protect some of the remaining rain forests areas of South America, which provide a refuge for the majority of the remaining jaguar population\n\n\nWish you the best and I hope that this is helpful to you and your assignment!

You're right; notice many of the commercials have subtitles....\n\nAmericans have not traditionally grown up playing soccer (many do now, but I think as they get older, it loses its lustre). It is the same way with hockey. We don't grow up being passionate about it (as a group), so no, most do not care about professional soccer or the World Cup in the least. (I didn't know the World Cup was only every four years until this year.) \nHockey's strategy of changing the games so that none end in a 0-0 tie was smart. \nAny sport that can end in a 0-0 tie (especially when the minutes count upwards instead of down) is really not appealing to most Americans. \nTherefore, most companies prefer to spend money on the NFL and MLB because they end up generating the most revenue. It is a vicious circle, as soccer would need more money and sponsors to become more popular, but to become more appealing to sponsors, it needs to be more popular.\nSergio-great answer!

I worked for many years in community mental health and I know exactly what you are talking about with regard to services. The problem here is that liberals have infiltrated the offices that supply those services and routinely reject people who aren't pawns in their plans to overthrow the government by bankrupting the social services systems. That means no welfare for you if you are white, not an addict, not an illegal, not a felon etc.\n\nYou need to understand something. Although this is the rule, not the exception in most major metropolitan areas, it is also highly illegal. What you need to do is get a lawyer (one's who specialize in this are a booming business in these areas) and serve them with a letter of intent to sue. This will cause them to immediately approve your aid (at least it used to work 100% of the time in Cook County, where I worked) These people know that what they are doing is illegal and they definitely don't want to be sued as that would most likely result in alot of people being fired and setting back the marxist revolution or whatever. None of that is your problem. The situation exists because all your idiot neighbors vote irresponsibly and don't pay attention to these issues. You can't change it and shouldn't even try. Instead, you need to focus on your own health and well being and getting what you need from the system.

One of my professors in college stated to me:"if you want to see a change in others...you might start with yourself"\n\nDon't REACT to situations(unless you have to run for your life, etc), but think first. \n\nMaybe ask him why he does not respect what you are watching(but DON'T raise your voice), ask him softly(like a woman). Tell him you want a better relationship with the only father you have, and ask him also what does he think that could be done to bring you closer. Maybe include your mother in on this. Sometimes it is the child who becomes the teacher. Start somewhere with small bites...try to make a joke when adversity strikes, or even smile. It disarms the other person, and calms the situation.

Oligarh - in Russian spelling. \nThis is, obviously, a refernce to oligarchic type of economy, where large portions of national economy belong to several big players, conglomerates, trusts, and etc. \nNew Russians (Novy russkiy) - is not necessarily an oligarch. He may be a head of big oil or metal exporting venture.\nAnd so-called oligarchs, most probably, bought their ventures due to extremely low pricing on auctions during 1990-s. For instance, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is believed to have bought Yukos oil conglomerate for approximately 200 mln $, while its original price was about 2 billion.\nRussians themselves consider ALL rich people got rich at expense of somebody's life. It is some component of Russian mentality.

Actually, most fish do have teeth, but the number varies greatly depending on what kind of fish you're talking about, what species, and even what age the fish. The numbers go from zero to tens of thousands.\n\nFor example: The great white shark has 46 teeth in its Front Row Dentition, but there are any number of teeth behind each of those teeth ready to take their place should the front tooth be lost. The cownose ray usually has seven series of teeth on their dental plate in each jaw. Each series has 11 to 13 rows exposed and functional at any one time, fitted into an interlocking pavement of hexagonal, pentagonal and tetragonal shaped flat grinding surfaces. \n\nSome fish not only have teeth along their jaws, but also in the bones on the roof of their mouth (vomerine teeth), and along gill rakers.\n\nFor rabbits, most of them have 2/1 incisors (2 top, 1 bottom), 0 canines, 3/2 premolars and 3/3 molars for a total of 28 teeth. One genus(Pentalagus - the Amami rabbit found only a small island off Japan) has one fewer upper molar on each side, so they have only 26 teeth.\n\nIn toads, the number of teeth is also variable depending on species, but in most the number of teeth is set for each species. It is often used as a characteristic to define a species. Often the teeth of many frogs and toads are very small, barely more than spicules, and not easily visible to the naked eye.

Yes I have, but first I want to talk about what it means to be worst or first. Success isn't achieving a popularity contest after you've been nothing to the crowd. Success is overcoming your own personal weaknesses and making them strengths. \nThis is my success - eight years ago I was critically injured, damaging my brain and fracturing bones on one side of my body. After a coma, I had months of therapy every day. Learned to open my mouth, make noise, hold my head up, sit up, move on command, make sounds, into words, stand up with the help of a person, sit in a wheelchair. You get the idea - stand up by myself and walk, to speak and talk to people. Count, write, and went back to college later that year with a wheelchair, then a walker, then crutches. It was hard, but I wanted bad enough to keep going. Finally I walked on my own, took driver's ed at the university, studied, became part of the national honor society in my field, and graduated from college. After that, I became a personal trainer, then a massage therapist. Please don't assume that because I went so far, it was easy. It wasn't. It was grueling and exhausting. I was dealing with depression and had to fight urges to hate myself. \nI am a success. I don't say that because I work downtown, training executives in an office building, or massage across the street at the city's swankiest hotel. I am a success because I never gave up. Life's not over, I still don't give up. That's success, you just keep going.

Aorta is the largest artery in the body, the aorta arises from the left ventricle of the heart, goes up. ( ascends ) a little ways, bends over (arches), then goes down (descends) through the chest and through the abdomen to where ends by dividing into two arteries called illac arteries that goes to the legs.\n\nAnatomically, the aorta is traditionally divided into the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and descending aorta. \n The descending aorta is, in turn, subdivided into the thoracic aorta (thatdecends with the chest) and the abdominal aorta (that decends with the belly.) \n\nThe aorta gives off branches that goes to the head neck, the arms, the major organs in the chest and abdomen, and legs. It serves to supply them all oxygenated blood. The aorta is the central conduit from the heart to the body.
Yes the original iMacs and the iBooks both use the same type of ram. The type in question is 10 ns SO-DIMMs.\n\nHowever the standard ram packaged with the iBook SE, was the 64mb attached directly to the motherboard, therefore it can not be removed. The only way you'd be able to swap ram over to the imac is if the iBook has been upgraded from the standard configuration.
A slurry is a mixture, which comes in different varieties:\n\nMetal Slurry can be used in pipe fitting and other welding tasks, as well as slurry based bombs like the BLU-82. \nIn farming—perhaps the most well-known use—farm slurry is a mixture composed chiefly of water and animal sewage. It has a distinct odour, noticeable when the substance is carried in tankers, or spread over fields. Misapplication of farm slurry can lead to environmentally damaging emissions of ammonia and other chemicals. See fertilizer. \nA liquid mixture (especially involving water) composed of a mixture of various insoluble matter, such as mud or plaster of paris. \nA special kind of slurry consisting of approximately 1% pulp (wood fiber) and 99% water, used to make paper, is called stock in the papermaking industry. \nSlurry pipelines are a specialized method of material transport that use a watery slurry to move particulates from location to another. \nIn wildland firefighting, slurry is a term used for the fire retardant dropped on a forest fire from an aircraft. "Slurry bomber" is a colloquial term for those aircraft. See aerial firefighting. \nIn cooking, particularly in restaurant kitchens, slurry refers to a mixture of a thickening agent (often cornstarch) and water, as a means of dispersing the thickener into hot sauces and soups near the end of the cooking process without forming lumps. Slurry can also refer to the mixture of coffee grounds and water in some kinds of brewing processes, such as a french press. \nMeat slurry is a product made from meats, making them more readily transportable, as well as removing fats, pigmentation and myoglobin. \nIn mining, slurry is a sort of liquid waste material that's stored elsewhere.

Saturn's largest moon is Titan.Titan is the fifteenth of Saturn's known satellites and the largest.\n orbit:1,221,830 km from Saturn\n diameter: 5150 km\n mass: 1.35e23 kg\nIn Greek mythology the Titans were a family of giants, the children of Uranus and Gaia, who sought to rule the heavens but were overthrown and supplanted by the family of Zeus. \nDiscovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. \nIt was long thought that Titan was the largest satellite in the solar system but recent observations have shown that Titan's atmosphere is so thick that its solid surface is slightly smaller than Ganymede's. Titan is nevertheless larger in diameter than Mercury and larger and more massive than Pluto.\n Surface view One of the principal objectives of the Voyager 1 mission was the study of Titan. Voyager 1 came within 4000 km of the surface. We learned more in the few minutes of that fly-by than in the previous 300 years. Then in late 2004, the Cassini orbiter began a series of close encounters with Titan, taking data with many instruments. And in January 2005, the Huygens probe actually landed on the surface of Titan and sent back images from the surface. \n Titan is similar in bulk composition to Ganymede, Callisto, Triton and (probably) Pluto, ie about half water ice and half rocky material. It is probably differentiated into several layers with a 3400 km rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystal forms of ice. its interior may still be hot. Though similar in composition to Rhea and the rest of Saturn's moons, it is denser because it is so large that its gravity slightly compresses its interior. \n Smoggy Titan Alone of all the satellites in the solar system, Titan has a significant atmosphere. At the surface, its pressure is more than 1.5 bar (50% higher than Earth's). It is composed primarily of molecular nitrogen (as is Earth's) with no more than 6% argon and a few percent methane. Interestingly, there are also trace amounts of at least a dozen other organic compounds (i.e. ethane, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide) and water. The organics are formed as methane, which dominates in Titan's upper atmosphere, is destroyed by sunlight. The result is similar to the smog found over large cities, but much thicker. In many ways, this is similar to the conditions on Earth early in its history when life was first getting started. But it is this thick hazy atmosphere that makes it so hard to see Titan's surface. \n Titan has no magnetic field and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's magnetosphere. It is therefore directly exposed to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere. It may also drive some of Titan's peculiar chemistry. \n At the surface, Titan's temperature is about 94 K (-290 F). At this temperature water ice does not sublimate and thus there is little water vapor in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, there appears to be a lot of chemistry going on; the end result seems to be a lot like a very thick smog. \n There are scattered variable clouds in Titan's atmosphere in addition to the overall deep haze. These clouds are probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics. Other more complex chemicals in small quantities must be responsible for the orange color as seen from space. Analysis of the Huygens data will tell us a great deal about the details of the atmospheric chemistry. \n Erosion features Prior to Cassini's arrival, it seemed likely that the clouds would produce a rain of ethane or methane onto the surface perhaps producing an "ocean" up to 1000 meters deep. However, this seems not to be the case at least at the present time. There is little doubt that some active processes are occuring on Titan; there are few if any craters visible indicating that the surface must be very young. But it may be that the "lakes" are more slushy
Sailing is the process of getting in a boat and causing it (by the use of sails, paddles or motors) to move across the surface of the sea, a lake or a river. \n\nGoogle sailing, shipping or navigation for more info as it would take far far far too long for us all to give you full details on here!

You're absolutely right. Part of the problem is that many people are afraid of what they don't understand. A different religion or belief, can't be comprehended. They don't have any other resort but to make fun of it, belittle it and try to put it down. Trying to make their own beliefs above the other one keeps them from ever having to expand past their own horizons.\n\nAside from being hurtful, the other downside is that they learn to look beyond themselves and simply never grow as a person or spiritually because they're never really challenged in their faith. Without a challenege, how do you know how really faithful you are? And people want the easy way out of everything. It's human nature.\n\n**As a side note**\nI don't see how she's being hypocritical at all. She's simply asking why people have to be mean and hurtful, not that people can't share their beliefs, or even have their beliefs about other people. You didn't answer her question, you proved her point.

You invite your teenagers friend to your house as often as possible and try to be a positive influence on the friend. By having them to your house, you can tell if you really should disapprove of the friend or not. If you say something negative about the friend, you will labeled as the old person who just doesn't know how things are today. By having the friend to your house and being kind towards the friend, you will look like the good guy in the eyes of your teenager and, if the friendship lasts more than a few weeks, you will be in a much stronger position to question certain aspects of the friend that you disapprove of.
Landslide by the Dixie Chicks.\nMy partner and I had been together for five months and everything felt so great. I was at University in a town far away from my home town and he lived in the town my University was in, working in a warehouse. My mother wasn't in favour of our relationship even though I was nineteen at the time, and told me I had to come home for the Summer. At the time, I didn't want to make her mad- and my father was really abusive and would have hurt either me or one of my sisters who still lived at home.\nI announced I had to go home for the Summer. I wrote it in a letter because I couldn't bear to tell him. We were and are really inseperable. \nI went into the bathroom and burst into tears, as he read the letter. When I came back into the bedroom, he was sobbing on the bed and had put on a song he said reminded him of me. It was landslide by the Dixie Chicks. The lines 'I'm afarid of change because I've built my life around you', really moved me and he was inconsolable. \nI managed five days back in my home town before I realised I could have a new life away from the abuse and emotional blackmail. I think that song tripped a switch in my brain that told me to go back to the man I love.\nI can't listen to that song now, it reminds me of our struggle to be together and how we had to build everything from scratch- how when I returned to him I did not bring anything because if I took a suitcase my parents would surely have realised what I was doing and made it so I couldn't go anywhere. My partner bought me clothes, he worked extra hours, and later I found a job so we could have a life together.\nWe are getting married in Feb and that song will play at our wedding.\nSorry this was so long, I just felt like telling someone...
The fire combined with major structural damage caused the collapse. The fire was obviously initiated by the jet fuel, but was further sustained by combustible objects in the building.\n\nWhile it is not frequently discussed, the Twin Towers were rare in that their outer walls were structural (load-bearing). Typically, buildings have widely spaced columns. This type of design was heavily dependent of on the steel floor truss systems to distribute the load. As the fire weakened (important note - not melted) the floor trusses, the vertical members gave way to excessive loading caused by a failure to distribute the loads.\n\nThe excessive weight above the points of weakening caused a rapid, catastrophic failure - observed as pancaking of the floors below the initial point of failure. \n\nIt has been argued that because the building fell at free-fall speeds, which is largely accurate, it could not have possibly been failure of members due to vertical loading. However, consider the sheer weight and momentum applied to each floor as the one above it fails. These are extreme values that no building could withstand.

Till the country was divided on the basis of caste, religion and creed but now it seems that some greedy people are dividing India on the basis of boundries and regions. Is it not enough for these kind of people that they are living in a country, trying hard to feed over its 1 billion public. \nsome time, the sound of some like minded faces become so strong that it looks that it repersents the whole community.I am sure that if done a survey in Telangana region, the demand of any\nnew state would not a issue with majority of the people.\nfirst of all they want employment and resources. they have nothing to do with o old state or new state. \nTheir repersentatives should negotiate with the union govenrmnent for some economic and social assistance rather than screaming the demand for seperate state.\nManmohan Singh was quite right when he did not adhere to the demands of its local politican Rao, who was alliance Party for making UPA, for conferring Telgana a seperate state. but for how long, the UPA would not oblidge his demand. I have had apprehension in the mind that perhaps the congress could grant it a status to meet its both ends near the 2009 general elections. \nIn my view,this demand would achieve nothing. it would not only augument the administration budget of government but surely would divide the nation and foment the similar demand in other parts of the country.\nI just put a simple example- we always say unity is the strengh but what we are thinking or doing- Just smashing and crushing that unity amidst some self-inflicted motives.\nIf that area has had some problems then it could be sorted out with a suitable planning. A layout or a rehablitation plan could be chalk out for bring back its prosperity.

I copied this from the "best of" craigslist page, but the message was too important *not* to share.\n \n \n \nProud of your country? Your leader? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDate: 2006-03-21, 4:38PM PST\n\n\nI am ashamed. I am ashamed of this President. Aren't you? After watching his press conference today, a sense of shame overtook me. I'm ashamed that he took to the podium today as if he emptied out a container of laughing gas. I'm ashamed of a President who has the temerity to laugh when asked a question about war. I'm ashamed of the whores of the fourth estate who care more about having the honor of being the butt of one of the President's jokes than about exposing the truth to the American people. I'm ashamed that millions of my fellow Americans are so scared and so desperate for leadership that they believe the President's bullshit. \n\nI am ashamed. I'm ashamed of this President, this megalomaniac hellbent on leaving his assprint on the map of the Middle East, no matter how much destruction is wrought and no matter how much blood flows in the streets of lands that never threatened us. I'm ashamed that when I see the American flag waiving, images of flag-draped coffins flash in my mind. I'm ashamed of Freedom's March. Ashamed when I see villages reduced to rubble. Ashamed when I see the tiny little corpses. God, they're so painfully tiny--lined up in a row, little angels wrapped in colorful blankets that starkly contrast against their gray-tinged faces. Ashamed when I see wailing Iraqis slam their hands against plain, unvarnished coffins, over and over, asking "Why? Is this democracy? Why?" When I see those image of funerals, of broken families, I want to crawl into my TV, I want to go to them and grab their slumped shoulders and scream "I'm sorry, good god, I'm so sorry. I want to leave, I want us to leave, believe me. But they won't listen...No one listens anymore." \n\nI'm ashamed that the word "massacre" is even uttered in connection with our actions in Iraq. I'm ashamed it's not just one massacre that is alleged, but two. I'm ashamed it's gotten to the point that I can't even tell this little voice inside of me to shut up, that little voice that says maybe, just maybe it could be true. That the impossible may be plausible. Before this war, I would have rejected such claims outright. But that voice of plausibility is the consequence of those black hoods. It's the consequence of those leashes, those snarling dogs. It's the consequence of those detainees chained to bedframes. Of naked pyramids. Of forced sex acts. Of beatings and blood-streaked floors. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that Justice is no longer blindfolded, but gagged. Ashamed that in America, in AMERICA, I can only protest in "free speech zones" the size of postage stamps. Ashamed that by the time I'll take my oath as an officer of the court to support the Constitution, I'll be swearing to uphold a tattered document that has managed to survive over 200 years only to be shredded by this President in less than eight. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that in America, I see bearded men panhandling in the street, holding cardboard signs that read "U.S. Vet, can't work, need food. God bless." Ashamed that somewhere, in our America, a grandmother is sitting alone at her kitchen table, crumpled bills clutched in her thin hands, agonizing over the choice before her: medicine for her pain, or food to keep on living. Ashamed that there is a child who will go to sleep tonight on a cot in an orphanage, with no one to read him a story, no one to stroke his hair and kiss him goodnight, because the American Taliban thinks gay Americans can't love, can't parent, can't provide. \n\nI am ashamed of my fellow Americans. Ashamed that they haven't fl

I have dated people from different races and have always been opened to learning how everyone view themselves in society. Being African American and brought up in a christian home we were taught about "unconditional love". When we get to heaven there is no black section or white section but all people section. God is a artist, He created many things different and with beautiful color and contrasts. Look at people and you should see the canvas God used to create such masterpieces.

yes you can. there is no shot for hep-c. and one thing to let you know hep is a blood to blood transfer. stay away for needles drugs or tatoos that is how most of the hep-c is spread. my wife had hep-c and we were very active in the bedroom without protection. after 2 years i never got it myself and she got it from drug use years ago. so don't let that stop you from loving someone.
Osama Bin Laden lives in the white house. This is my belief because whenever 9-11 first happened and president bush sat there like a dumb dick, the first thing he did was flew Sadam husein's family to a safe place. I don't understand why people still believe that we should be over there "fighting the war in iraq". There is nothing more to do. We are just gonna keep losing our troops. What the predisent needs to do is send his troops over to where the real disaster was, (Huricane Katrina) and clean some stuff up. I wish the president would actually pretend like he cared about someone other than himself and the rich people.
That is correct when you are felon you cannot even cross from the United States to Canada. So no, no passport for her.
It works regardless. It may take a little longer to really feel it if you take it after you eat , and a little less if you take it on an empty stomach.
I think you meant to say "How did the disease diabetes get its name?" but no matter. I believe the name diabetes comes from the Greek word diabainen, which means to pass through (that could be like a siphon). Hipprocrates coined the name because of the diabetic characteristic of excessive excretion of urine.

PLEASE CHOOSE MINE THE BEST ONE\n\nGALLARDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nThe Lamborghini Gallardo is the Italian supercar maker Lamborghini's "entry-level" car, sitting beneath the Murciélago. It is also the first car to feature the new Lamborghini V10 engine - only the third engine designed by the firm. 3,000 Gallardos were built in just two years, making it the company's most-produced model to date. The second-place Diablo took a decade to sell 2,903 examples.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Gallardo was designed as a competitor to Ferrari's 360 Modena, and now competes with its replacement, the F430. The car is named after a famous breed of fighting bull and is pronounced roughly "gah-yar-do". Gallardo is also Spanish for the word gallant. Although performance is lower than the Murcielago, it is still very high, and the Gallardo has much better rearward visibility and, according to reviewers, is more maneuverable as well as more tractable in low-speed traffic, making the Gallardo a much more practical car to drive. It is also much more practical to use in bad weather than many other supercars, thanks to rear-biased all-wheel drive. Although corporate owner Audi is renowned for its Quattro AWD system, Lamborghini uses a system of its own.\n\nHowever, to the disappointment of enthusiasts, Lamborghini did not fit its signature scissor-doors as on the Murcielago, and some owners have fit their own, vertical-opening doors. Lamborghini chose to keep the doors exclusive to the V12 models, as it has done since the Countach when they were first introduced.\n\nAt current U.S. prices, a base Gallardo costs about $165,000.\n\nThe Gallardo uses a V10 engine based on Audi's old straight-5 design. This engine was split again to become the straight-5 engine found in the new Volkswagen Jetta. The 5.0-liter engine is a current Audi 4.2-liter V8 (featured in Audi's S4, A6, A8, and Q7 models) with two extra cylinders added and a slightly smaller bore diameter.\n\nThe Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled auto-clutch manual, or, as Lamborghini abbreviates it to, "E-gear". The latter allows the driver to make shifts much faster than an automatic transmission would, with the control that a manual offers. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, and does not need to manually actuate the clutch.\n\nAudi, Lamborghini's current owner, plans to offer its own sports car based on the Gallardo architecture, the Audi R8. It would use a V8 in place of the Gallardo's V10 to avoid competing directly with the sister car.\n\n\nGallardo Spyder\n \nThe Lamborghini Gallardo Spyders at the 2006 LA Auto Show.The production spyder model of the Gallardo was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January, 2006. It is considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with 520 hp (388 kW) and a lower-ratio six-speed transmission. The soft top is fully retractable.\n\nAerosmith drummer Joey Kramer was the first person in North America to take delivery of the spyder model of the Gallardo.\n\n\nGallardo SE\nIn late 2005, the Gallardo SE (for Special Edition) was introduced. The SE is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by having a black roofed two tone color scheme as well as specially designed "Callisto" rims shod with Pirelli tires, the interior of the SE also follows the two tone scheme. Mechanically, the SE addresses many of the criticisms of the original Gallardo; the steering is quicker and more responsive, the gearbox gear ratios have been adjusted to better suit the V10, and the E-gear now has a "thrust mode" to optimize acceleration, and its power has been increased to 520 hp (388 kW). The SE has a higher top speed of 315km/h, (196mph), and it accelerates to 100 km/h in 4.0 seconds. Only 250 units of the Gallardo SE will be pro

Taurus & Virgo \nWhen Taurus and Virgo come together in a love affair, it's a union of innate practicality. Both of these Signs employ practicality in their daily lives as the most efficient means to most problems. They can be quite sincere and devoted to one another; as people, both have a great deal of integrity. Virgo likes Taurus's strength and dedication while Taurus appreciates Virgo's quick mind. \nDue to Virgo's naturally cautious nature, this relationship can take awhile to develop, but once it's established that both partners are in it for the long haul, it's like a runaway locomotive, running on its own power and difficult to stop. These two Signs have much in common: They highly value common sense and practicality; they're both materialistic but work hard for the creature comforts they so enjoy. Taurus is more sensual and indulgent than Virgo is; Virgo tends to be the inhibitive force in the relationship, tending not to get involved in the chaos of life in favor of analyzing all available options. Virgo's analysis leads to criticism, which Taurus can tend to take too seriously. Conversely, Taurus's stubborn nature can get on Virgo's nerves, causing Virgo to criticize even more! This pair must take care not to take one another too seriously. The good thing is, they're similar enough that they can learn to be patient with one another, especially Virgo, who loves to indulge Taurus's penchant for fine treatment and good food.\nTaurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Virgo is ruled by Mercury (Communication). Both of these Planets are close to the Sun, so they're closely related though they seem very different. Venus is physical; it's about romance and sensuality, both of which are important to Taurus. Mercury is about communication and it's androgynous -- Virgo will take on the form that it chooses. Virgo is very good at understanding other people and can easily learn to be the romantic and sensual partner that Taurus loves. Both partners are so devoted and romantic, their arguments surely won't focus on those issues. \nTaurus and Virgo are both Earth Signs. Earth Signs are steady and practical, concerned with possessions. Taurus and Virgo together love to surround themselves with beautiful things -- an opulent home, gorgeous artwork, classy cars. Their love of luxury and their desire to be financially secure ensure that this couple will work hard who never overspend. \nTaurus is a Fixed Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn and tends to make up their mind for good; more flexible Virgo can help teach Taurus the value in bending the mind a bit -- when it's practical, of course. \nWhat's the best aspect of the Taurus-Virgo relationship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and Virgo likes helping Taurus achieve their goals. Their common interests and desires make theirs a highly compatible relationship.

File a motion for modification. I don't know how it is in California, but in Colorado, the forms are readily availible online. Note in your petition how many overnights you have, and document the money that you are already paying her. Get receipts, bank statements, etc. Probably like most human beings who don't live with a lawyer by their side doing running commentary, you didn't get receipts from her, but gather up all the witnesses you can. Note: I don't blame you for that, but the lack of evidence might hurt you. \nThe courts usually don't care about your expenses (sad, but true), but on the whole, they can't take what isn't there.

In 1481, being discontented with his progress in Florence, he left for Milan.\nAgain came the thrust of war and again Leonardo's inventions poured from his fertile brain.\nIn a letter to the Duke of Milan he said he would build him "safe" unassailable covered wagons with artillery". Tank warfare to be "invented" in the 1914-1918 war had been invented. \nHe also invented for the Duke's use an explosive shell - shrapnel - poison gas and a protective gas mask, but once again was laughed at.\nAfter the war had receded Leonardo also invented a spinning machine, a look, a needle-sharpening machine and a metal rolling mill but his patron the Duke had no interest in machinery. He gave Leonardo a commission to paint a picture on one of the bare while walls of the refectory of the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. When it was finished it was the immortal "Last Supper".\nIn 1499 the French King Louis XII conquered Milan and Leonardo left for Venice. He arrived just as the Turks had defeated the Venetians at Lepanto and Turkish warships were threatening the city itself.\nThe council of Venice, having heard of Leonardo's ideas of military weapons consulted him about the defence of the city and almost overnight this ever amazing genius invented the submarine and the diving suit.\nThen, for some reason which has never been explained, Leonardo left Venice before either of his inventions could be used and returned to Florence.\nAgain came war, for Cesare Borgia, Prince of Romagna, decided to enlarge his principality by the simple expedient of absorbing his neighbouring states. To this end he invited Leonardo to become his military engineer, giving him the rank of a general.\nAfter two years, however, Leonardo returned to Florence which had become involved in war with Pisa.\nHe was again consulted and this time his mighty brain envisaged a scheme which was as fantastic as was devastating. \n\nThere's a whole lot more on the site

Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri on May 23, 1999, during the WWF Over the Edge PPV event. He was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena for a scheduled WWF Intercontinental Championship win over The Godfather.\n\nIn keeping with the Blazer's new 'buffoonish superhero' character, Owen was to be lowered to just above ring level, at which time he would release himself from the safety harness and then comically fall flat on his face. He had performed the stunt only a few times before, and was worried about performing the stunt at Kemper Arena due to the height involved (Owen had a fear of heights).\n\nOwen performed a practice stunt earlier in the day, and the stunt went forward on the show as scheduled. His wife Martha suggests that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Owen unintentionally triggered an early release and fell 78 feet (24 m) into the ring, smashing his chest on a padded, but still tough, ring turnbuckle.\n\nTV viewers at home did not see the incident or its aftermath, as the WWF was transmitting a promotional video package for the match, and only showed the audience while Owen was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring while WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that what just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly.\n\nOwen was transported to the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, where he was pronounced dead on arrival (he actually died about six minutes after the fall, while still lying in the ring). The cause was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt chest trauma. He was 34 years old. The WWF chose to continue the event, which drew a great deal of criticism over the following weeks, especially as the main event of the evening involved The Undertaker (also known as the "Deadman") winning the WWF Title.\n\nThe next night on Monday Night Raw in St. Louis, Missouri, a two-hour televised tribute was broadcast (see RAW is Owen), in which WWF wrestlers and officials paid tribute to Hart. The Over the Edge event name was retired.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, much attention focused on the harness Owen used that night, especially on the "quick release" trigger and safety latches. When someone is lowered from the rafters in a harness, there are backup latches that must be latched for safety purposes. These backups may take some time to unlatch, which would have made Owen's stunt difficult to perform smoothly. Therefore, it was apparently decided that it was more important not to have the safety backups, because it would be easier for Owen to unlatch himself.\n\nIn addition to not having safety backups, the harness Owen used was designed for sailboats and required only six pounds of weight to trigger the quick release mechanism; Owen weighed about 225 pounds. An out-of-court settlement between Owen Hart's family and the WWF has prevented the release of any information about the harness. The WWF, however, decided to ban stunts of a similar nature from this point on to avoid a similar event from occurring.\n\nOwen left a widow, Martha, and two children, Oje Edward and Athena. Martha Hart settled her wrongful death lawsuit against the WWF for approximately $18 million[citation needed], and used the funds to establish the Owen Hart Foundation. Martha wrote a book about Owen's life in 2002 called Broken Harts.\n\nOwen's last match was on May 22, 1999, in Chicago, Illinois. He and Jarrett won a tag team match against Edge and Christian.\n\nOn the October 4, 1999 edition of WCW Nitro, Owen's brother Bret Hart wrestled Chris Benoit in an Owen Hart tribute match at Kemper Arena.
Digestion, or the break-down of your food, begins in your mouth with saliva. The main absorption of nutrients occurs in the intestines. If I remember correctly, however, if you swallow any of your saliva after chewing (but not swallowing), some of the food will inadvertently be digested, thereby consuming calories on a limited basis.

As far as I understand, it's okay to enter on a 6 months visitor's visa. In fact, it is now possible to enter the country on the visitor's visa and THEN apply for permanent residency using the family class. Apparently it is even faster this way.\n\nIt makes sense, as long as you are clear to immigration that you are entering the country as a visitor and are prepared to depart in six months if your permanent residency doesn't come through. But if you declare at immigration you are intending to reside here, and you don't have your permanent residency yet, that may pose a problem for you at the border .\n\nMy father is entering this way and has communicated with Canadian immigration to confirm this is okay. But please don't take this as advice, just anecdotal experience.

Aqua fortis, in alchemy, is a corrosive solution of nitric acid made from saltpeter. It was used in alchemy as a solvent for dissolving silver and most other metals with notable exceptions of gold and platinum that can be dissolved using aqua regia.

Why and to whom did the dr.'s office give the information? Drs. are allowed to disclose certaiin information without your consent under HIPAA in various situations. It sounds like the information was given to your employer. If you had insurance through your employer, and they needed certain info in order to process a payment or obtain insurance benefits, the dr. may have been allowed to give out the info under HIPAA without your consent. HIPAA does not prevent the disclosure of information, but limits it to the "minimum necessary" to accomplish the reason for disclosure. Based on what you typed, you may not have a case against the dr's office. Additionally, HIPAA does not allow a patient the right to file a suit against the dr, employer, or insurance company. Only the federal government, through the Office of Civil Rights has the ability to bring a suit under HIPAA. You can have them check out your case by filing a complaint with the OCR in Washington.

Here are the reasons for the one-way traffic:\n\nPoor bowling in last few overs. Though they kept it tight but, after having them at 209/7, it was too much in the last few overs. What really surprised me is that they let Andre Nel score few quick runs, well it´s not few for someone like him.\n\nPoor team selection. Sehwag was fit to play the last game and was even included in the playing XI (11). So, what went wrong so suddenly with him that he couldn´t take any part in the match? He was injured, accepted. But, why did they include Wasim Jaffer? Replacing the most attacking batsman with most defensive one, why? Why left out Irfan Pathan? Apart from Dravid, he was the only man who played exeptionally well in the practice. Scored 34 runs and took 1 wicket for 38 runs in 9 overs. So, that´s not bad at all. And more so, they left him out for such a pacy and bouncy track. He would´ve been really helpful on that kind of track, and morever, he even gives India a extra option of batting.\n\nThe setting of the batting order was worst I have ever seen since I born. Imagen that if the target was like 270+, what would they have done then? Openers: Sachin Tendulkar, a batsman who plays at normal pace, neither so attacking and nor so defensive. Wasim Jaffer, making the record of playing the most defensive opener in modern era of Cricket after Simon Katich. He would have been helpful in the middle-order. I think India could´ve replaced Sehwag with someone like Dhoni. Attacking replaces attacking. But, untill Chappell dies, Dhoni would never come up the order. He is a very fickle minded man. Dhoni now would bat up the order only in the 20/20 game, and then he would again visit South Africa for 20/20 Championship to bat up the order. So, after Jaffer it was turn for Kaif to come out in the middle to spend few 100 balls. And he did the same, scored 8 off 19 balls in 39 runs stand with Sachin. And then Dravid. He had to come out in anyway because the start was there. So what he needed to do was to stay there.\n\nBad captaincy. What was the need to bowl full qouta of 10 overs with Harbhajan Singh? He got thrashed around the park by de Villiers in his 1st 5 overs. Whereas Tendulkar and Mongia bowled superbly to restrict them in middle-overs. Why didn´t he allow Tendulkar to bowl full 10 overs? Why didn´t he bowl few more overs with Mongia to take the pace off the run-rate? Why didn´t they include Kumble in place of Harbhajan Singh. Kumble has more flight in his bowling which helps on his kind of tracks. I think Dravid has to make such decision rather than letting Chappell do everything.\n\nFor the moment: The alarm bells are ringing for chances of India winning the World Cup, yesterday rang the 1st one.\nIt will need some great performance by India to even draw or win the series, which is looking very bleak. And if they can do this, it will really be a confidence booster for them.\n\nRawal.

>>>>>Why does the earth and other planets rotate, but not our moon?\n\nThe Moon does rotate, It has day length of just over 28 days. If the moon didn’t rotate then it would show different faces to the Earth as it orbits us, and there would be no ‘dark side’.\n\nThe Moon doesn’t appear to rotate to an observer on Earth because gravitational forces have forced the rotation of the Moon to synchronise with the Earth, the two bodies are tidally locked. As a result the moon rotates at exactly the same rate as it orbits the Earth. It orbits once a month and it rotates once a month. \n>>>>> But just why does the earth rotate anyway? \n\nIt’s called conservation of angular momentum. The Earth condensed out of a massive cloud of dust and rock billions of years ago. That cloud was all spread out over billions of miles, it covered the entire circular orbit path we take around the Sun as well as stretching half way to Mars and halfway to Venus. It was big cloud. And it was spinning very slowly because of the way it was formed.\n\nThe cloud gradually condensed under the influence of gravity and became a small Earth. But when a spinning object gets smaller it can’t just stop keep spinning at the same speed, it has to keep spinning faster. You can see this principle applied by ice skaters working up speed. They start spinning with their arms out to make themselves bug, but when they pull their arms in the get smaller and spin faster. The same thing happened with the Earth. When all that spinning dust got pulled in from billions of miles away the Earth got smaller, and as a result it started spinning a lot faster. So fast in fact that it became noticeable to observers on Earth ( if there had been any) that the Earth spun around totally once a day.\n\nOf course it took another 2 or 3 billion years for life to arise, and another 4 billion years for life to get clever enough to figure out that the Erath did rotate and that the sun wasn’t whizzing around us.
I think the best answer would be false.

What shareholders want the cost to be has nothing to do with the price of the stock.

An EXCELLENT question...\n\nConsidering current circumstances, I think having any more than two children is self-destructive, in both the personal sense (raising children isn’t easy) and in consideration of humans as a species.\n\nWe, as humans, have VASTLY overpopulated the earth to a dangerous extent. Through doing so, not only have we driven exponentially more animals to extinction than any other natural cause combined, but we are also driving OURSELVES to extinction by depleting our habitat - the entire planet - of natural resources and polluting the ones we do have. We all complain about death rates, but somehow our birth rates STILL exceed them. We complain about lack of food, shelter, necessities; we overcrowd our adoption centers and foster care systems with unwanted children or children of parents whom are unable to properly provide for them; and yet, if we were to STOP HAVING SO MANY CHILDREN these tragedies would slowly decrease and diminish all on their own.\n\nBy having more than two children, you are furthering the suffering of our species as a whole in lieu of your own selfish desire for more children. Only have as many children as will replace you and your partner when the TWO of you perish. After that, you are only contributing to the self-destruction of our species.
Bad idea. The other person will enjoy the date, but will think less of you the next day.\n\n(Originally this said "the guy will enjoy"... then I read some of your other questions. Oops, sorry. Same rule still applies though, I assume.)
Yup, any object which sits inside another object is a child of that object. That's all there is to it. Normally, a child object will inherit the same rights and permissions as the parent object, but you can actually go in and change the permissions. For instance, say you have a file folder for financial stuff. The permissions for this folder may be open to all. Then, inside this folder, you have other folders for each individual person in the house. These would be child objects of the main folder. You could then go in and change the permissions so that only that particular person could open that folder and no one else could, even though they all have access to the main folder. I hope this makes sense.
I have been a pump user since 1995 and have used all the above. I favor the silhouette infusion set personally because it lies more flush against the skin and doesn't catch and possibly snag on clothing like the quick release. Also, I don't particularly care for the use of poly-skin dressing as it tends to irritate the skin. The silhouette can be quickly released, leaving only the infusion set flush against the skin surface and they come with stopper clips for bathing, but aren't really necessary. I would cleanse it with an alcohol swab anyway for sterilization though.\nBest of luck and I hope your choice works best for you...it's really a matter of personal preference really.\nBTW, you may find more information on these items at www.minimed.com Also, the new 722 is awesome as it has a bolus wizard and is compatible with the Guardian Real Time continuous glucose monitor. It communicates glucose readings directly with your pump and alarms when your glucose levels are too high or too low. There is good information on this at the mini med website. Again, much luck to you...live long and live healthy.

Letters: Paul, James, Peter, John, Jude all wrote 'letters' included in the New Testament. 23 Years reading it in Greek tells me that someone else wrote Hebrews, though it is traditionally attributed to Paul, the internal evidence STRONGLY points to another writer.\n\nStrange... With about 60 semester hours of Bible, I've never run into the "book of the letters" meaning Biblical texts. Origen, and a few other "church fathers" composed multiple letters which have been compiled into 1 or more "book(s) of letters." I would have to know in what context the question is asked to give any real attempt at an answer on that.\n\nYes, John most likely wrote the fourth Gospel which commonly bears his name.

As you have surmised to "lollygag" is to dawdle, fool around, and just generally do everything except what you should be doing. As a verb, "lollygag" (or "lallygag") dates back to around 1869, and a noun form, meaning "nonsense" or "foolishness," showed up a bit earlier, around 1862. \n\nUnfortunately, the origin of "lollygag" is unknown, but there are clues from which we may, perhaps, be able to extrapolate the roots of "lollygag." ("Extrapolate" in this context, by the way, is a fancy word for "guess.") \n\nFirst up in the batting order of possible "lollygag" clues is "loll," which is a very old word originally meaning "to droop or dangle." We use "loll" today to mean to relax or pass time idly, the sort of behavior that vacations are designed to encourage. There seems to be a plausible connection between this "utterly relaxed" meaning of "loll" and the "wasting time" sense of "lollygag." \n\nAnother bit of evidence might be found in the fact that "to loll" also means to let your tongue hang out, and that "lolly" is an English slang term for tongue (quite possibly the source of the name of our friend the lollipop, by the way). Perhaps "lollygagging" arose from the perception that lazy lollygaggers were adept at exercising only one muscle -- their tongues.

Spinning the tire will spread the fluid along the outside perimeter of the tire. The tire pressure will not affect nor disperse the liquid because of the density of the fluid is greater than the density of the air and gravity will keep the denser material on the bottom. However, the centrifugial force of spinning when greater than the forced of gravity placed on the material will allow the material to spread in the direction of the greater force. i.e. , as the tire spins the heavier material will spread along the outside preimeter of the tire in the direction of the force both away from the nucleus and in the direction of rotation.

The thing people forget or are confusing in this whole issue is that that the people that are rioting over the Danish cartoons think that the governernment of Denmark has something to do with the printing/content of that paper. Here, is the US, decisions on what to print are made by editors based on what they personally deem 'newsworthy' or what will sell papers, providing it isn't libelous or slanderous. Freedom of speech means you cansay anything you want and I will defend your right to say it. I DO NOT have to agree with what you are saying to want you to be able to express it. I personally, thought the cartoons were in poor taste, as I would any cartoons of someone else's religion. But it isn't illegal in the US to print bad taste. See most all of our newspapers for reference...\n\nWhere there is no free speech/free press, what is in the papers is an extension of the government. Here, the press is frequently counter to the goverment. They help to keep them in check.\n\nHolocaust/racist cartoons don't get printed in the mainstream press not because they against the law, but because they will upset people and cause the paper not to be bought. The Islamic cartoons weren't printed here, either, for the same reasons.

Why did they take it out? Were you overpaid? If not, the best thing you can do is talk to a lawyer, but his fee might be more than what your check was worth. You could try contacting the labor board also, and see what they say about it.\n\nGood luck.
The Brihadisvara temple was built by the great Tamil ruler, Rajaraja Chola I of the Chola dynasty. The shikaram, an octagonal, carved cupola, itself is very large and heavy and, until recently, was thought to be carved out of a single stone. However during one of the cleaning efforts, it was found to be in two pieces. The task of carrying this huge crown to a height of 70 meters is another feat worth mentioning. In order to do this, an inclined plane of sand was built from a distance of nearly 11 kilometers. The place where this scaffold began is called the Sarap pallam.

Think of all your interests & ask yourself if any of those could be expanded into a business. Just keep in mind...what's your expertise? What are your interests? What could you imagine yourself doing?\n\nThen, once you have some ideas, research, research, research. Check out the competition -- their business practices, pricing, customer service, etc. And also think about what you could offer to set yourself apart from these other companies.\n\nCheck the sources for some handy sites.\n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million).

I was circumcised at age 40, by choice and in response to a suggestion from my (then new) wife, who had had experience of sex with both cut and uncut men before she met me and very much prefers a circumcised partner for a whole range of reasons. The answer to your question is a resounding YES - my orgasm increased in intensity markedly after I got rid of my foreskin and frenulum and most men who have been circumcised as adults will agree with me on this. Also, circumcision enhances comfort, appearance and hygiene, together with making sexual sensation FAR better for both the man and his female partner. Unlike most of the anti-circ posters here, I know what I'm talking about from personal experience. Circumcision should be automatic for all males - there is no downside to it at all.

The song is called "Someone To Watch Over Me".\n\nTechnically, all of last night's songs were sung by Rod Stewart. However, this is because he re-did it on one of his recent albums.\n\nThe song was originally written by George and Ira Gershwin, as part of the musical "Crazy For You". Over time, it has been sung by many artists, including Frank Sinatra and Sting.
Simone... there is an old saying. If you straddle a fence, all you get is a sore crotch! Step over to one side or the other! By the sounds of it, if your b/f makes you feel like crap, then you should be looking to move on and find someone that won't. A man worth having lets you know AND FEEL that you are special, and important to them. So, if your current b/f makes you feel like crap, then take your dump and move off the fence. Good luck!

Glycerol is used as a cryoprotectant at concentrations of between 5 and 20% for a number of reasons. Firstly, however, you need to know why a cryoprotectant is needed at all... Cells would otherwise be in some type of buffer and media, which if frozen, would cause ice formation inside and outside the cells, causing their death due to various reasnons including the freezing and non-freezing of solutes causing local increases in concentration, and ice crystals can cause rupture of membranes, as well as some other effects. Glycerol is therefore used as a cryoprotectant which allows for vitrification to occur, which is basically the lowering of the freezing temperature of the solutin as well as the increasing of its viscosity. This process prevents crystallization (ie. the ice crystals which are harmful to the cells). Obviously there are a number of cryoprotectants, but glycerol is cheap, fairly non-toxic to the cells, and since it is a polyol, provides some nutrient value to the cells.

There are a number of volunteers who never finish their assignment; more than half cannot handle the pressure.

She will not be in a massive amount of debt, but if she quits after finishing training she will have to return a certain sum of money -- like relocation allowance, living allowance, things that she should not have spent if she quits early. \n\nI hope that she will not back out, as the experience is very rewarding. I greatly enjoyed my time overseas and would like to have extended it, but the bureaucracy only approved a limited number to do so. \n\nWhat country will she be going to? What assignment -- teaching, environmental, health? \n\nLet me know if you and she have any more questions.

Tell people you graduated, and then if they check just say you were homeschooled. But, didn't want to make a fuss about homeschooling. I have my GED, but I still write on application that I have graduated high school. I have never been caught. Jobs that require high school diploma are usually no big deal jobs - so they never check. Believe me, I have been lieing for 20 years, and have never been caught. But, ya know... I'm in Real Estate, and I make more money than College grads. I have always been my own trailblazer. Remember this: In America you don't need any degree to be successful. You just have to ambitious, and a go-getter.

That's a good question. The team they fielded in 2003 was the best team they've had in 50+ years. I think a combination of heart and desire is what makes a team a champion.\n\nLook at the White Sox. I really don't think they have the most on-paper talent in baseball, but they did the little things it takes to stay close in games and win them.\n\nThe Cubs need a collection of players that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and play like a single unit instead of a bunch of individuals. I think Derrek Lee, Aramis Ramirez, Michael Barrett, and Todd Walker fit that mold. The big questions are in the outfield. How well will the new guys fit in? People think their pitching is suspect because of Wood and Prior, but they have a very deep minor league system.

Just know, their main objective is to make money and not cure you. Psychiatrists have been known to "treat" people for 3 or more years, unllike doctors who typically only take 3 sessions to do something. The human mind is difficult to understand now, and even though you may improve, the effects are temporary. If you get sick of pyschiatric treatment, just pretend you've gotten better, or actually get better through some soul-searching or daily excercise.
Simple answer: because most of their arguments do not hold water when challenged on logic and merit.
Starting salary is at $100 - $150 plus benefits, signing bonus, bonus, etc. In good years (dot com era), bonuses could be multiple(s) of the salary. Then there's always the other perks such as food, frequent flier miles, etc. Long hours required.
His understudy was van der Gouw.\n\n- Schmeichel's successor was Bosnich.\n- Nick Culkin (not Rachubka) played 10 seconds or so in a game against Arsenal after van der Gouw got injured during the match. Bosnich was injured before the game.\n- Fergie then brought in Taibi, and you know what happened\n\nNext season, he bought Fabian Barthez. Bosnich was let go, and Roy Carroll was his understudy now. Andy Goram had a short spell too.\n\nAfter Barthez left came Tim Howard. Carroll continued to be backup.\n\nThen we now have van der Sar, plus Kuzczack(?) as understudy. Carroll was released, and Howard left on loan.\n\nThat's about 10 then.\n\nEDIT: I forgot Ricardo. Third choice Spainard who had a couple of games.

I was dx'd May 4, 2005 (I'll remember that date for a long time). Mine started out with optic neuritis, but I didn't know that's what it was called (November 2002). It lasted for about a month or two, then went away. Then in August of '04, I developed a headache, and it lasted until January '05, at which point I became dizzy/uncoordinated. After the dizziness went away, so did the headache. Went for a check-up,... yadda, yadda, yadda,...I have MS. \n\nI have problems with balance/coordination, bright flashes when I move my eyes, as well as spots/squigglies when I get tired, intermittent numbness/tingling, and other things. I've been using Copaxone, so I hope it will help. But I'm doing pretty well, considering the diagnosis. \n\nGood luck to you! I hope your taking one of the ABC drugs! If not, you need to.

that notion came from Carl Sagan, the author of the novel "Contact" that was later made into a movie starring Jodie Foster. Now in the book what he actually said was "we are made of starstuff". He meant that we are made of what stars are made of, as is anything else in the universe. Meaning we all things in the universe are made of basic chemical or even atomical components that are common to everything in the most basic level. It was not meant to be perceived as "if i cut my arm off and grind it up to very small pieces it will turn into space dust".

You can do it, but with some modifications:\n\n1. You need to replace tyres... the ones with air wont work there.\n2. You need to refit body parts of super light weight materials... the weight is crucial in space program, the heavier, the more fuel it will require to lift it off the ground\n3. You will have to dissassemble the entire machine including the engine to fit it into the space shuttle. Then you need an engineer to assemble it back\n4. You will need to modify the design to withstand the air preasure in mars. It is not like earth.\n5. You will need special fuel to run it on mars... the ones they sent ran on batteries. So another huge load of batteries required.\n\nWell from the looks of it... you already have a shuttle that can travel in space and withstand high preasure... you already have the fuel in the shuttle to make it run. You already have tyres that withstand high and low preasures.... you already have the heat shields in place... you already have people who know how to fly it.... you already have the material that will require to be remolded and refitted... well... all you need to do is modify the shuttle to look like a bigfoot monster truck.

The earliest cars (and even wagons) used front-wheel steering and rear-wheel steering would have to have enough advantages to overcome that early start. The mechanical steering mechanism is more direct for front-wheel steering even after adding power steering. The vast literature and experience favors front wheel steering, including racing cars. The interaction of steering, suspension, tire action, over and under-steering are not trivial effects.\n\nA huge ship uses a rudder for rear end steering and must move the stern all the way to port or starboard, the full length of the ship, to make a right-angle turn. This might prove difficult for a car in traffic let alone a huge semi. Of course long fire engine ladder trucks do use both front and rear steering to maneuver sharp corners, but not at maximum speeds.\n\nLastly, in most cars the heavy engine is up front and an important part of steering is to get that huge mass moving in a different direction. The weight of the engine produces greater loads on the front tires that better grip for steering.\n\nAs with a ship, the shorter the car the more practical would be rear-wheel steering and a small car with two front tires and a rear engine and only one rear tire might do just fine.

Yes every town and every state has low income housing. First there are the apartments that bas your rent on your income. They take 10% of your income and that is what your rent is. BUT you can only make sooo much money to qualify for it. Then there is section 8 and that is where you find your own house, and the landlord has to agree to accept rent payment from the state u r in. Alot of landlords like this cuz they r guaranteed to get their rent on time every month but alot do not like it because the house you pick has to have an inspection- all windows have to have locks and 2 exits- back and front door. Things like that. For section 8 they put your name on a list and u have to wait for your name to come up.
Well, since that's a name, I don't think it would be any different in Spanish.

All energy comes from the Big Bang. The nuclear reactions are the source of everything else that came thereafter. There is as much energy in the universe now as there was nanoseconds after the Big Bang. Energy conservation applies to particle and antiparticle interactions as well, therefore, there is no conflict when refering to quantum fluctuations.
Pluto the planet was discovered in 1930, Pluto the dog was created in the late 30's I think, so Disney probably was inspired by the discovery of Pluto the planet\n\nNot that it relates to the question but a lot of people are saying now that Pluto isn't technically a planet.
Reverse thrust is the temporary diversion of a jet engine's output so that the exhaust gases are blown forwards rather than backwards. The resulting thrust force acts against the forward travel of the aircraft.\n\nA shield is moved in place behind the engine which diverts the thrust forward.
First thing I would like to say should get good practical knowledge of remote administration for WEB Server if you intended to work from Lebanon.\n\nPost your resume on internet and provide you can administer WEB server remotely. It would be hard as you will fresher but that is you have to prove that you can do.\n\nSecond options do find job in Lebanon it self with LAN management which is good for experience. Even bigger LAN management is challenging job.\n\nGetting job with MCSE is not Q but is there job around in local market or international market. If you have I.Q for programming (It is not I.Q but urge to make programs) then it can be clubbed with networking that can pay really well. \n\nPassing MCSE through dumps can lead you nowhere well Passing that could make you eligible but that wouldn’t teach you much it is all you have to decide.\n\nLinux is another good option and there are business who wants free software to deployed in there networks. Only issue lack of trained Linux engineer and programmer for there in built requirements. \n\nHope you can decide on it.
Most common causes of epistaxis (nosebleed) are:\n1. Trauma (accidental..or nose picking-seriously)\n2. Inflammation (infection, allergy, drug abuse-cocaine for example, dryness)\n3. Foreign body\n4. Coagulation disorder\n5. And yes other things like hypertension, anti-coagulant usage, excessive alcohol intake.\n\nYou said that it didn't clot, but eventually stopped? Either way, consult with your physician to make sure it's nothing more serious, soon.

I was a youth leader a few years ago, and I know that if you make the material relevant, they will be interested.\n\nDespite what one of the answerers says, kids DO want to learn, they are just tired of having to memorize facts and dates and doing busy-work. They've been doing it for YEARS, you know?\n\nWe need passionate high school teachers--passionate about their subjects, and passionate about their students.\n\nI know a teacher who has his students do a family tree--isn't that great?! They learn something about their OWN heritage and history, and then fit it into a larger context.\n\nAnd use music. Nothing grabs their attention like it--and I know you can use today's music--either juxtaposed or complementarily.\n\nHigh schoolers are just like us--if we can connect something we KNOW to what we have to learn, we pick it up much more easily.\n\nWhat's going on right now that they care about? I know my son--a senior next year--is disgusted with the state of affairs--the environment, people driving gas-hogs, politicians lying. \n\nHow exciting for you! And what a gift to be able to touch young lives in a way that will impact them for years to come.\n\nGood luck!
First start with DVD Decrypter, because if the disc gives you read errors at this point, it's probably either too scratched/scuffed to copy or has a new copy protection scheme.\n\nUsually, if a DVD movie works with DVD decryper and gives no read errors, you should be able to burn the disc without a hitch.\n\nIf the disc completes in DVD Decrypter, then open the files in DVD shrink and it should work.

Other than looks, it is used to protect scrapes, cut and bruises if there are any. Also, it provides warmth to the area that is more convenient than wearing tights completely underneath the shorts. Players also wear them to give their calf more pressure, that helps them feel more comfortable especially if the calf/shin area has had surgery performed in the area (the surgery may have caused lossed sensitivity). Lastly, some players wear them because of superstition.
Congratulations on your promotion! \n\nYour goal is to motivate your employees to accomplish the goals of the organization.\n\nBe supportive and encouraging of your employees. You are the team leader and make sure that you show them that you are willing and able to help them, especially when it's busy. Always remember what it's like to be an entry level employee so you don't forget what motivated you.\n\nEncourage your employees to do their best. When they screw up, don't yell! Instead, calmly talk to them and help them to learn how to stop making the mistakes. \n\nRemember that in training it's not just explaining it, but ensuring that the employee UNDERSTANDS what to do. People learn best by doing, rather than just being told. So show them and carefully explain, then watch them to make sure they understand.\n\nPraise the good work they do. Recognize the people when they do something to take care of the customer. Commend an employee when they go out of their way to gain customer satisfaction.\n\nDo NOT belittle an employee, and don't gossip. As a fast food manager, you want the employees to work together as a team. \n\nEach day, try to remember something the employees did well and commend them for doing that.\n\nBe approachable to the employees and you will build their trust.\n\nThe best supervisor I ever had would come up and tell me that he appreciated my work and was glad that I was working for him. Then he would ask me how I liked my job and there was anything he could do to make my job easier or if I was having problems with anything. You know what, he had the employees going out of their way to make sure he was happy.\n\nDon't hide information from them. It ticks me off when I'm told to do something but not given information WHY I'm doing something. \n\nCredibility is important. Walk the walk. Maintain integrity with them. If you promise them something, deliver onthat promise or explain to them why you cannot deliver what you promised.\n\nThere will be those problem employees that are not motivated to work - they are there only for a paycheck or to socialize with their friends. I'd recommend doing a search on motivational strategies. \n\nGood luck to you! If you are asking questions like this, it sounds like you are definitely trying to make a good impression. And you know what? A person who makes an effort deserves the benefit of the doubt. Just remember to stay focused on your goals. If you keep a positive, can do attitude, you will do very well.\n\nCongratulations and best wishes on your future!

The Roman Year used to start on March 1st so the last day in February was New Year's Eve.\n\nMy understanding is that there always were 12 months, as the word is derived from Moon, which rotates around the earth once every 29 days or so. 12 times and a bit in a solar year.And September is simply the 7th month, starting counting from March as the 1st month. \n\nSo I think the idea that there were ten months is jumbling the facts. December was the tenth month but it wasn't the end of the calendar year, January was then the 11th and February the 12th month.\n\nMarch 1st being the year-start makes it kind of logical to add or subtract days at the end of February. When we added a leap second a few years ago, it was added to the end of the year on 31st December. Our current year-end.\n\nAs far as I know, there was only one change of length of month because of honouring an Emperor. August used to be 30 days long. When they added a day to make it 31 and equal the length of July (to imply Augustus was Julius' equal) and named the month August, it was at this point in time that they changed February from 29/30 days to 28/29 days.\n\nSo before Augustus Caesar's time there were people with birthdays called Feb 30th but nobody with a birthday called August 31st... that date simply did not exist in the calendar.\n\nSo if you asked "What day of the week was August 31st in BC 100?" the answer would be that there was no day called August 31st in 100 BC. It is a trick question, like "What was the next day after September 2nd 1752?" (in England) to which the answer is "September 14th 1752!", because that was the year the Julian Calendar was changed to the Gregorian Calendar and 11 days were lost from September that year.
I hate to keep on hearing this question but I think it is because the league (and all fans) are just hurting to find the next Michael Jordan. It happened with Kobe, Vince Carter, Grant Hill, etc.. This last finals thats all I would hear. Wade would be the next Michael (after the 4th game mind you). But I do not think he will be as good as Michael. I think they are giving Wade too much credit, he is still very young. And he has earned this respect from refs in just 3 yrs. And I think this whole fall 7 times get up 8 thing has gone to his head. He falls for every little touch now. Soon kids everywhere are going to be falling down on the court with every little touch to get a foul called. I do not think he has been in this league long enough to be getting touch fouls called on him. It took Jordan a hell of a lot longer, but I think that goes back to the league really hurting for another Michael Jordan. But don't get me wrong, I think Wade is a great player. He has a great mid-range jumpshot, is great at getting fouls called, great at the free throw line (which gets his midrange jumpshot going), and an ok driver to the basket and finisher. But no way the next Michael Jordan.
good i have a friend that had a tough home life and she went to live with foster parents they are all much happier now

Really, you should do your own homework.

You cheat and ask strangers to give you answers ot regurtitate.\n\nVery disappointing.\n\nThere are no dumb quetsions, but there are certainly dumb questioners with even dumber motivations for questions.

Send your resume to your future employer of choice, make a promise to give them first choice to hire, and ask them if they will buy your book and if they have any work-study program that gives you employment during summer and/or vacations.\n\nBasically, I think you are dreaming about getting some book like this for free without some exchange of value.\n\nLearn to use the library better, and they can also get a loan of rare books from other libraries (don't lose them!!!) or may consider your recommendation for references, especially if endorsed by faculty and other students.

sounds like your typical 14 yr old. They get that age and know it all. This is not always a bad thing. She is rebelling. Try some reverse psychology on her. Try acting like you dont care either. Plus, when she acts like this she is getting lots of attention from everyone telling her she should do it. Have everyone stop doing this and act as if they dont care if she goes or not. Have them talk with her about other aspects of her life. This will take the focus off of this and she will be more willing to go. good luck

They are "smooth jazz" stations, not really jazz. "Smooth jazz" is the latest trend in jazz programming. They include mellow jazz people like Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Fourplay, Kenny G, etc along with mellow adult contemporary singers like Steely Dan, Sting, Sade, Norah Jones, yes Celine Dion, and people like that. A lot of times these singers have jazz elements. Of these people listed, Steely Dan, Sade, and Norah Jones certainly have elements of jazz.
1. Work out the moles of pure Mo.\n2. Multiply by 3 to get the moles of hydrogen.\n3. Use V = nRT/p to calculate the volume of hydrogen.\n4. Going back to the moles of Mo, multiply by 7/2 to get the moles of oxygen, and do a similar calculation to get the volume of pure oxygen.\n5. Multiply the volume of oxygen by 100/21 to get the volume of air.

It depends on the type of tube. Hot cathode tubes use thermionic emission - that is, you heat a sample of an easily ionized substance (i.e., low work function) to a high temperature. A very small fraction of the atoms will be stripped away by the electric field.\n\n"Cold cathode" discharge tubes use very high electric fields to strip the electrons. Again, a very small fraction of electrons will be stripped away from the cathode element. \n\nThe material at the cathode is the source of electrons. Only a very small fraction are ionized. Electrons eventually will be replenished from tiny leakage currents (the gas in the tube, the glass, etc.). The electrons at the anode initially will combine with positively charged ions (electron holes), which will then propogate as a slight current to the source of EMF.

There are many reasons why a period could be missed including diet, stress, pregnancy, infection, and hormonal balance. As pregnancy blood tests are the most accurate, it is best to have one done 2 weeks after a missed period. If it turns out to be negative, then your doctor can do further testing to see what's going on.

Can't answer for others but myself\n I don't think that having sex outside of marriage is bad because you know what you like when you get married\n if you have never had sex before marriage then you may hate it or at least hate it with that person and think this is not worth it stop having sex with them which will end up in divorce more than likely \nwhere if you had had sex prior then you know what it is all about\nthat's just my point of view on it
This again depends on the coin itself for starters. Most jewelers or pawn shops will not buy something like that at the cost of gold as they would have to refine it, which costs money and/or time.... Maybe you could get 60% od spot price of total weight of gold, now remember that the kt also plays a factor.... such as 14kt gold is only just over half percent pure gold....if you have a half ounce and its 14kt, with gold at $700 per oz figure 60% of $350 if you are lucky and find the right place. You may wish to try a coin shop as the coin itself may have its own value beyond the gold... Good Luck

Kurds (kûrds, kʊrds) , a non-Arab Middle Eastern minority population that inhabits the region known as Kurdistan, an extensive plateau and mountain area in SW Asia (c.74,000 sq mi/191,660 sq km), including parts of E Turkey, NE Iraq, and NW Iran and smaller sections of NE Syria and Armenia. The region lies astride the Zagros Mts. (Iran) and the eastern extension of the Taurus Mts. (Turkey) and extends in the south across the Mesopotamian plain and includes the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nAs of the late 1990s, there were estimated to be more than 20 million Kurds, about half of them in Turkey, where, making up more than 20% of the population, they dwell near the Iranian frontier around Lake Van, as well as in the vicinity of Diyarbakir and Erzurum. The Kurds in Iran, who constitute some 10% of its people, live principally in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, with some in Fars. The Iraqi Kurds, about 23% of its population, live mostly in the vicinity of Dahuk (Dohuk), Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Sulaimaniyah.\n\nEthnically close to the Iranians, the Kurds were traditionally nomadic herders but are now mostly seminomadic or sedentary. The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Kurdish dialects belong to the northwestern branch of the Iranian languages. The Kurds have traditionally resisted subjugation by other nations. Despite their lack of political unity throughout history, the Kurds, as individuals and in small groups, have had a lasting impact on developments in SW Asia. Saladin, who gained fame during the Crusades, is perhaps the most famous of all Kurds.

There is a description of heaven in the Bible. It's found in Revelation 21.\n\nI'm curious as to why you categorized this under Dental.
In a patient with a dry socket, blood does not fill up the extraction socket or the blood clot is lost. The gums can not grow over the extraction socket because there's nothing to grow over and the hole remains open. This opening causes a constant dull throbbing pain and the patient can often have a foul smelling breath and bad taste in the mouth. Ear pain is another possible dry socket symptom.\n\n It's called a dry socket because the hole, or socket, that the tooth used to fit into becomes dry. It begins hurting about three days after oral surgery. Unfortunately, the pain lasts about a week after it begins. The dental name is acute alveolar osteitis. Acute means all of a sudden. Alveolar is the name of the bone that supports teeth. -itis means inflamed and osteo- means bone. Osteitis means bone inflammation. Acute alveolar osteitis means sudden inflammation of the bone that supports a tooth.\n\n Dentists don't know exactly what causes a dry socket. It occurs more with lower teeth than upper teeth and more with females than males. The problem occurs more often after difficult extractions. It may be that forceful pushing against the wall of the socket when the tooth is being removed causes the walls of the tooth socket to become crushed. This prevents bleeding into the socket because the blood vessels have been crushed closed. The lack of blood then causes severe pain.\n\n Anything that dislodges the clot can cause a dry socket. Forceful spitting or sucking though a straw can pull a clot completely out of its socket. Patients should wait a day before rinsing with warm salt water to avoid dissolving the new blood clot. When salt water rinsing, spit gently to avoid pressure. Carbonated beverages should be avoided because they may bubble the clot out. Alcoholic drinks can dry out the blood clot and prevent healing. Avoid smoking for a few days after dental extractions because smoking can disturb clot formation. Patients who have recently had oral surgery should avoid anything that may irritate the socket or anything that may cause the clot from being dislodged. Follow our oral surgery post operative instructions carefully to avoid dry socket treatment.

David sins in numbering the people. Pleading with God for mercy, he is given the choice between three punishments: seven years of famine, three months of military defeats, or three days of pestilence in the land. David replies: “Let us fall, please, into the hand of Jehovah, for many are his mercies; but into the hand of man do not let me fall.” (24:14) The nationwide pestilence kills 70,000 persons, being stopped only when David, acting on Jehovah’s instructions through Gad, purchases the threshing floor of Araunah, where he offers up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices to Jehovah.\n\nDavid had the choice of '1' punishment out of '3', he took "pestilence" and this was the cause of 70,000 people to die, David asked God to forgive him and God did forgive him.\n\nThe Bible says that the "righteous & the unrighteous" will be resurrected, so we have to leave it up to God.\n\nHilter belonged to the "Catholic Religion" The Negative Side of this is:\n\nHitler’s religion was not much of a deterrent to him. This led sincere persons to wonder why an appeal made to Pope Pius XII to excommunicate Hitler was never answered. The Catholic Telegraph-Register of Cincinnati, Ohio, under the heading “Reared as Catholic but Violates Faith Says Cable to Pope,” reported: “An appeal has been made to Pius XII that Reichsfuehrer Adolph Hitler be excommunicated.” If this action had been taken, might it have affected the outcome of the war and helped spare mankind much suffering? Sad to say, the pope never responded.\n\nHitler’s religion was not much of a deterrent to him.

In every part of the Reich von Papen was to be heard exhorting the faithful to blind obedience to Adolf Hitler.”\n\n“In early 1933 the following official announcement was made by the body corporate of Catholic action and thought in Germany, then led by [Franz] von Papen: ‘We German Catholics will stand, with all our soul and our full convictions, behind Adolf Hitler and his Government. We wonder at his love for fatherland, his energy and his statesmanly wisdom. . . . German Catholicism . . . must take an active part in the building-up of the Third Reich.’”\n\nFranz von Papen was instrumental in achieving a concordat between the Nazi government he served in Germany and the Vatican in Rome. The concordat was signed July 20, 1933. A special communiqué stated: “Cardinal and Secretary of State Pacelli [later Pope Pius XII] to-day bestowed on Vice-Chancellor von Papen, the Grand Cross of the Order of Pius . . . Vice-Chancellor von Papen presented to the Cardinal Secretary of State a Madonna of White Meissen Porcelain as a gift of the Reichs Government. . . . All gifts bore the dedication: ‘A memento of the Reich Concordat 1933.’”—All quotes taken from Franz von Papen—His Life and Times, by H. W. Blood-Ryan.
Kobe Bryant simply because he is learning how to be a team player. He was averaging 6.3 assists in the playoffs. He knows that he has a quality team, they just need someone else to complete the triangle. Ron Artest would have been the perfect addition. I think that the Lakers are going to find a really good center this off-season. They are in the building mode right now. Give them a few years, and they will be hot. But, the Heat on the other hand have many players that are on their way out the door. Payton, Mourning, Shaq... all players that will retire in the next 5 years. Who will Wade be left with? Haslem??? ha. Kobe has the better situation to win more titles.

The merchant's machine authenticates the account with the financial institution that issued the card. Basically this is checking to see that the card number is valid, and the card itself is valid.\n\nSwiping the card sends the card information, and transaction information to the financial institution. The financial institution returns a numerical code. The code can either be approved, or a trouble code that denies the transaction. If the transaction is denied with a trouble code, the specific code maps to an English definition for the denial of credit.

Well, you'll need to be more specific than that. \n\nA file update can be done two ways: 1) by completely overwriting the existing one with a brand new one, or 2) by actually checking the bytes in old vs. new files, make comparisons, and develope a "difference script", so a "patcher" can use the difference script, plus the "difference" in content, to stitch together a new file. \n\nApproach 2) is definitely more complicated, and slower, theoretically, but the patch file would be tiny compared to the whole program. \n\nWithout knowing the internals of that "simple file update program", I'm going to guess it uses method 2 or something similar, thus the internals will move around.
unfinished business, not accepting ones mortal demise, there are so many theories...but can you prove anyone of them? Basically proving the existence of ghost is about the same as disproving them. Pictorial evidence are all over the web and I have a few unexplained pictures I've taken myself. Vocal recordings when no one had been present? Another case of hauntings..so do people come back and why the come back ? The reasons are as various as the theories.
No. It would be sexual harrassment if he had made comments about your butt. Keep in mind that just because he looked at your butt it doesn't mean that he finds your ass particularly attractive.If you are standing 10 feet away from someone and they are facing away from you, you can almost always see their butt.You really need to get over yourself.

That's really rough, I was in a similar situation in the 8th grade. I had gone to public school and then switched to a Christian school. It was hard cuz I left my best friends there, and I did lose touch with most of them. I see a few of them once in a while now. We talk cordially, but our lives went in completely different directions - I'm glad about that too, they're all 21-22 with kids. I guess my best advice to you would be to be nice - say hi, be like - hey we should do something sometime and catch up. Ya know, just play it cool like it doesnt' really matter either way. Good luck!!!
It depends. Some banks, instead of sending back your checks with every statement, send only copies of the checks, and this may include all checks deposited to the account. If you go online and look at the statement, you can click on any line item on the statement and it will bring up an image of that item, front and back. If Chase does that then yes, by going into the online statement and clicking on any item she will be able to see an image of that item.\n\nIf the deposit item in question is a check drawn on a local bank, you may be able to go to that bank and cash it, then take the cash and make a cash deposit into your joint checking account. This way all your mom can see is a cash deposit. if you don't even want her to see the cash, and need to pay some bills, take the cash and go to the post office and buy money orders for the amounts of the bills you need to pay, and send the money orders as payments. This way, your mom will not see any deposit at all, or at most a very much reduced one.\n\nI used to do all this to keep it looking like I had no income and no deposits to my checking account. Once I went to the post office and bought a total of $5,000 in a whole bunch of money orders, and only $300 or so actually made it as cash into my checking account. For all intents and purposes if you looked at my checking account it looked like I was dead broke and in abject poverty.
H o t A i r o v e r H o t W a t e r \n \n\nIn the 1500s, fishermen who lived in South America began to wonder about a current of unusually warm water that came to their shore every few years near Christmastime. Since the fishermen believed in the birth of the Christ child at Christmas, and since they spoke Spanish, they named the hot water El Niño, which means "the infant" in Spanish. \n \n\n Where do scientists look for El Niño? The hot water usually comes first to the coasts of Peru and Ecuador in South America.\n \nBut if we've known about El Niño for four hundred years, why is everyone talking so much about the hot water this year? \nThe 1997-1998 El Niño may or may not be stronger than ever before. Scientists are still deciding. One thing that is definitely different about this El Niño is the technology that scientists are using to study it. \n\n \n\n Scientists and governments from around the world—United States, France, Japan, Korea and Taiwan—are sharing knowledge and funding for The Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) Array. \n \nBut why all the fuss anyway about some hot water in the tropical Pacific Ocean? Well, it's not just the hot water. It's also the hot air. \nTry this: take two cups that are the same. They can be ceramic, plastic, styrofoam, whatever, as long as they're the same. Fill one with cool water. Fill the other with hot water. (Not boiling, just good and hot.) Place them on a table. Hold each of your hands over one cup and feel the difference in the air above the water. (Don't actually touch the water. Just feel the air.) The hot water warms the air above it. The cool water doesn't. \n\nNow, imagine you fill your bathtub with hot water. Think about how warm and steamy the air in the bathroom gets. Now, imagine millions and millions of bathtubs-ful of hot water. All of that moist, hot air has to go somewhere. Scientists know that hot air rises and carries the moisture with it. Once the moisture gets into the air and starts to cool, rainclouds start to form. \n\nNow try this: hold a small mirror over the cup of hot water for a few minutes. The moisture in the air should collect on the mirror, and, as it cools, form tiny droplets. Imagine the bathroom mirror after you fill the bathtub with hot water. The "water" on the mirror is caused by the water vapor in the air gathering and cooling. Now imagine the air over the hot water of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Huge rainclouds start to form and flooding results in South American countries along the coast.\nIt's not quite that simple, but the science of El Niño does start with those basic ideas about hot air over hot water.
What happens is they take you to civil court it is not a felony ,they dont issue no warrants and they place a judgement against you and you have to pay back-if your dont pay judgement it puts a mark on your credit and they will garnish wages (in some states)and get it back -point is ,it has nothing to do with the law-its a loan they handle it in civil court-dont get messed up with the payday loan stuff -it very hard to get back out of the hole.

Short answer:\nScientific man came up with evolution, and God came up with creationism. Scientific man declared that his is better, and foolish people, afraid to stand up for their beliefs, agreed with them.\n\nOh, and be sure you are not confusing things here:\n\nCreationism deals with the beginning of the universe. The scientific theroy opposed to this is called "the Big Bang theory."\n\nEvolution deals with the change over time of species. The faith-based theory opposed to this is called "intelligent design."

Toluene is so toxic that OSHA has restricted exposure to employees who come in contact with it at work. It is a hydrocarbon which can trigger asthma. It affects the Central Nervous System and cause euphoria, dizziness, confusion,depression, headache, vertigo, hallucinations, seizures, vision problems ,stupor, and coma. It may have direct on the Cardiac System. It can cause bronchial spasms and suffocation. Long-term exposure can damage the liver, kidneys, and skin. Inhaling this solvent can even cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. \nI have personally known people who had used it as a 'high' (sniffing correction fluid). They were in a mental hospital facility and had permanent brain damage. They had difficulty speaking. Their symptoms were like those of alcoholics with 'wet brain'. There is no recovery for them.\nIt is a SCARY chemical.

Have you ever heard of fifths disease? It's a little like measles.. very common but.. can be contageous.

Black people talk about us people being racists because they use that as an excuse not to move up in life, if you notice, a lot of them do not have an education, and they are part of gangs and stuff, and they have nothing good to offer to society, and that's the truth, there are counted black people who are doing something positive towards society and the world, but even some of them have done something negative in their past. They spend more time talking about others being racist against them, but instead of talking, they should be in a class room, learning history, and getting and education.

That all depends on what part of Healthcare management you'll be going for. Alot of websites say what the average that someone makes in a certain field, but do more research and compare how long it will take you to pay back your loans.\n\nTry looking on http://www.craigslist.com under the jobs section, and type in the specific job you'll be applying for after college, make sure to check out what type of schooling they desire to be an applicant. In the healthcare field, stay away from the "assistant" jobs, if you look around, they go through the same time amount of school as more specific programs, and get paid less than half. \n\nExample, look up "Medical Assistant" vs. "RN" and also "Dental Assistant" vs. "Dental Hygienist"\n\nIf you're already married, i'd definatly recommend going for a specific program like DHY, or RN. You'll make more money, in the same amount of time.

When you're doing homework, just remember it could be worse. There have been days this year when I've attended classes and done homework from 9 in the morning to 4:30 in the morning. Actually, for the most part, I love school... or I wouldn't do that. :-P\n\nI'm guessing your somewhere between 6th and 10th grade. I can assure you that school gets much more enjoyable when you finish high school. But that doesn't do you a whole lot of good for the time being. Are there any subjects you like? Do you dislike school because it's boring (i.e. too easy), or because it's too hard? Homework in middle/high school tends to suck because it's primarily busy work. Not a whole lot to do about that apparet from just not doing it (unless you actually do need the practice or the grade, in which case you should do it anyway).
I try to be honest...I dont answer a question if I dont think I can offer advise or feel like I have something to add.......\nYes..I answer what I really think\nHope your next question is a good one...this one was...so-so.....\nsee.....proof of my real feelings......
Yes. Inflation basically boils down to that money today is worth more than it is tomorrow. As inflation goes up, the value of the debt decreases. So you are paying off the same amount of debt, but it is worth less. That's why when inflation goes up, interest rates go up - to compensate the creditor for the lost value.\n\nGenerally, wages go up with the rate of inflation...but the amount of your debt does not. So while the buying power of a single dollar is less, your total buying power (hopefully) stays the same. \n\nOf course, no one wants hyper inflation. But it is a great way to get out of debt.

Is this a sub-prime lender? Sounds like it is to me.\n\nNo one is that swamped, this is a relatively simple thing to do. Sounds to me like your current lender is Ameriquest (which recently agreed to a 200M settlement for predatory lending and CAN'T do business in the entire state of CA anymore).\n\nSub-prime lenders can be notorious about getting a payoff out, because, once they loose the loan, they aren't getting paid anymore. Just realize, that they have nothing to benefit by releasing your mortgage; they loose.\n\nWith that in mind. You have to stay on them and threated legal action as well as reporting them to your state's department of licensing and finance.

There are many graduates. But law school is different. Many just go to get the degree. The degree seems to hypnotize a great deal of the public -- both the students and those who hire them. So law graduates may work in a wide variety of fields, many of which have nothing to do with the law. But they all let the right people know they have a legal education, and much more important, a law degree. And a world that can't distinguish image from reality says "You're just the sort of man we want."\nSo, yes there are "too many" lawyers if they all were actually lawyers. But the truth is they are in all kinds of different jobs. I wouldn't be surprised if MOST law school graduates aren't practicing lawyers.
A house we lived in during the mid 1970's was already 85 years old and people had died in it several times in all those years. Lots of unusual and strange things happened while living there. Also the house we just moved from last year had things happen in it. The first night there (only my husband and I) someone calling "Mom! Mom!" woke me up, but no one else was in the house. Also when I was taking my plate of food into the dinning room to eat, I glanced in the window and saw a reflection of a young man, looked to be about 20 or so. No one ever wore perfume or cologne or used any cleaning products with smells because of my asthma and every so often would get a heavy smell of like a man's after shave or cologne. Even people who were visiting would smell the after shave sometimes. And lots more stuff. The house was new when we bought and moved into it.
Because it's knowledge that we all share deep inside and deep inside is usually the last place we want to look.
What an awesome question. They do that by looking at families and ancient DNA.\n\nLet's say you have a type of gene that is passed down ONLY by your maternal family line, they can take blood/lymph samples from you, your mother, grandmother , great grandmother, aunts, great aunts whatever.\n\nIn reality this exists in your Mitochondrial DNA/RNA.\n\nIf you have a long family line like lets' say your ancestor was Charlemagne's sister or some famous person from whom they had tissue - hair / blood whatever. Usually they have to find relatively uncontaminated samples so tissue from roots of teeth or inside of large undamaged bone or if the tissues are in some other ways preserved. They enhance this DNA by making many copies of the tissue and then use that to do the comparison.\n\nThey can compare the genes from that old ancestor and see what kind of changes occur between the generations and your distant relative whom you know you are related to.\n\nThen you see what has changed between those older samples and the newer samples. That lets people know what the overall error or difference is. \n\nBy checking with everyone else or using multiple samples from multiple family tree's they compare and get a common set of changes between everyone. \n\nNow you can figure out the rate of change or put another way, how many years or how many generations is it before you can expect to see 1 error/change or 10 or 50 or 100. \n\nFor Mitochondrial RNA/DNA that is very well figured out and there is a great book about this subject called "The 7 Daughters of Eve".\n\nComparing the older DNA of a few individuals to people today has had some AMAZING results.\n\nFrom those results they have discovered some amazing facts, For instance,\n\nHumanity was almost wiped out as a species 2 times in the last 200,000 years (most recently about 70,000 years ago) , scientists determined there were no more than 5,000 people left after some event caused the population to dwindle. \n\nIn a way the story of Adam and Eve were right,(if I remember correctly) although Eve lived 80,000 years ago in Africa somewhere and Adam lived 40,000 years ago in the European Steppe.\n\nAll women decend from no more than 7 individuals who lived at various times in the last 40,000 years.\n\nAfricans are the oldest branch of the human genetic tree and show almost 10 times more genetic diversity than their indoeuropean and asian cousins.
I grew one inch between 17 and 22 yrs of age, the stopped growing at Six Ft one. \n\nBUT.... after looking at my posture, and doing some work on that, and once I had spent a few months walking, sitting and sleeping properly positioned my height was measured as Six Ft 2 and a half.\n\nKeep exersizing, eat well (nutrition, protien !!) and look at your posture.\n\nAvoid SMOKING !!! and dont get too drunk too often.
Some baseball players are fast, but some (like David Ortiz) are big and known for their homerun hitting abilities. The further you hit the ball, the less fast you need to be, and if you hit a home run you can take your sweet time.\n\nBaseball players use anabolic steroids to make themsleves get stronger faster and be able to hit the ball further easier.

Most of the people on this board are preteens and teens that have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to microprocessors.\n\nThe best processor available now is Intel's Core 2 Duo...period. This may change in time, however, as it stands right now, the Core 2 Duo is best. Anyone telling you otherwise is just an uniformed teeny bopper.\n\nPeople telling you that AMD processors run hot are beyond clueless. That USED to be the case years ago, way before the Athon 64. Until just recently (until Core Duo) AMD processors ran much COOLER than Intel processors, as excess heat was one of the reasons the Pentium line was scrapped. Now, in terms of heat generation, they're close to the same, with a slight edge going to AMD.\n\nIf you really want an AMD Turion system for your laptop, by all means get one, as they're not bad...just not quite as good at this time as Intel's offering. This may not remain the case though in the second half of 2007, when AMD updates its line.

yes.i also suprised that the wwe didnt go for a telented wrestler like AJ styles.for me he is the face of tna.and if AJ styles is on raw roster, he will be in the main card. hell, its not easy to find a superstar who is good at submission technical wrestling and high flying moves.most wrestler only have one of it.\ni think the reasons wwe didnt go after AJ is bcos the tna originals,(those who are not from the wwe..ect) was once said in an interview that they will never work for vince...

This is the site you want\n\nThe effect of 48 hours of water deprivation on the colonic temperature response to intrahypothalamic injection of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was investigated in adult male rats. Water deprivation did not alter colonic temperature of rats at a neutral ambient temperature. Administration of PGE1 at doses of 50, 200 and 400 ng gave rise to a short latency dose dependent hyperthermia in both control and water deprived rats. Water deprived rats had significantly greater increases in colonic temperature following the two higher doses of PGE1. Control rats and water deprived rats exposed to the cold (5 degrees C) had decreases in colonic temperature which were not significantly different. Water deprivation, which should increase the plasma levels of the putative endogenous antipyretic vasopressin, does not attenuate PGE1 hyperthermia but has a slight enhancing effect. Following food deprivation for 48 hours rats had a slight but significantly greater increase in colonic temperature following intrahypothalamic injection of 200 ng PGE1. Thus the water deprivation induced change in responsiveness to PGE1 may be due to the decrease in food intake which accompanies water deprivation. The mechanism by which rats exhibit an enhanced febrile response to PGE1 administration following food or water deprivation is not yet known.

ok sweetie i think that when shes not with her ex b/f then u should ask her out,unless you guys are really close friends and u dont want to ruin your friend ships plus if your not sure if she likes you or not, whenever you see her b/f treating her like s*** then stand up for her then she'll know that u truly are a good friend or(what you really want ) she'll think your boyfriend materail and let her know she can always come to u to talk or just for a shoulder to cry on
If it is online lottery you won through your email, then don't replay to such emails. On the internet there are lot of people cheating in this way. First they will ask to to pay some money. if you won ask him to deduct the the charges from your won amount. but they will not agree because there intension is to take mony from you. after giving mony they will not contact you. \n There are lot of cases happen in the past to be carefull and contact to police to arrest such criminal

Well, the working week has decreased dramatically over the past century. In 1906, a 16 hour day was considered normal, and our consumer culture hadn't evolved to have anything resembling a weekend. The reason we don't see even shorted periods is because our technology allows us to do more work in less time, meaning that 8 hours today can achieve, hypothetically speaking, 10 hours of work from the past. If we cut the number of hours, we would be loosing out on overall productivity. Some can blame this on greed of 'the corporations', but if you step off the soap box and take an objective look at our marvelously complex, comfortable and highly advanced society, you'll see that many of the things you take for granted simply would not exist if economic productivity decreased in such a way.

The 2nd Amendment, along with the other Amendments from the Bill of Rights, were designed to overthrow the federal government if it became too oppressive. Look at the entire Bill of Rights...almost all of the Amendments would be ESSENTIAL to overthrow a Government.\n\nThe individuals responsible for the Bill of Rights were opposed to a federal government. They insisted that the Bill of Rights be attached before they would ratify the Constitution. They are usually referred to today as the "Anti-Federalists", and those who were for the federal government were known as the "Federalists". \n\nYou can find some of the writings of the Anti-Federalists online, and there are some books printed that have their collective writings in them. Read them and you'll understand their thoughts, fears, and reasonings behind the Bill of Rights. \n\nMost people today, including the ACLU, are IGNORANT about the Bill of Rights. They were not designed to be "personal" rights (so to speak), but designed to overthrow the government...long may they stand.

you will need about 5 days with no stress for your arms to fully recover - you could do a leg workout though\n\nand when you go back learn from the lesson - make progress slowly!\n\nafter a hard training make sure you stretch - then use hot-cold showers for 10 minutes and if you have access to it a whirlpool or spa bath \n\n\nyou can also ice areas that have been worked very hard for 10-15 min every hour \n\n\na bath with epsom salts helps as does an ibuprofen\n\nmake sure you hydrate during and after training and have a protein shake and some fruit as soon as possible after training

All of the US states run welfare programs. Each state has their own rules. If you are able to work and qualify for welfare, you collect welfare while you are looking or training for employment. The welfare payments are limited to two years in my state.\n\nSome people cannot work and have never worked, so they do not qualify for Social Security. Say a person is blind and confined to a wheel chair. That person will never be able to work, so he is entitled to welfare for as long as he lives, or until state laws change.

No such beast exists. The book was simply lying.\n\nOliver is a plain old chimpanzee that has been tortured and abused so gullible people will pay money to see him and read books about him.\n\nA female chimpanzee was shot in a rainforest in Africa so her baby could be captured. The baby then had several of his teeth pulled out so his jaw would grow deformed. His head was burned with acid so the hair would not grow properly. The animal was then trained, almost certainly with excessive cruelty, to walk upright.\n\nHe was then displayed to gullible people as a monster. The only monsters were the people who did that to a helpless animal.\n\nGenetic tests have shown that Oliver is just a plain chimpanzee. In fact genetic tests have even confirmed which tribe in Africa he was stolen from.\n\nInterestingly since he started living with kinder owners his hair has largely regrown and he no longer shows a strong inclination to walk upright. \n\nPoor old Oliver is just a badly abused and cruelly mistreated animal. He has the same number of chromosomes as any other chimpanzee.\n\nNone of this is a secret, there are countless websites that will confirm this. This is why I can safely say the people who wrote that book knew all this and simply lied about it.

I would say maybe you hit a spot on your spine which is causing the numbness. Stress could be making your chest numb but I think it's more than that. Even though you/ve had an mri and x-rays done...sometimes they can't show the real culprit. I would advise to get some more opinions of other doctors, check medical websites...but definitely don't let this go. It could be serious nerve damage. If you hit certain spots on your spine, nerves that carry impulses to the brain malfunction and can't carry signals as well anymore giving you the feeling of numbness or tingling and can spread down your legs or arms. Good luck....keep searching for answers.
as of march 22, 2006 this is the latest news about him\n\n'Idol 4' finalist Constantine Maroulis leaves band for solo career\n\n \nUPI News Service, 03/21/2006 \n\n\nFormer "American Idol" contestant Constantine Maroulis has left his band to embark on a solo career\n\n\nMaroulis, 30, who was in the audience watching the current crop of "Idol" contestants compete Tuesday night, confirmed to People magazine he is no longer with the hard rock band, Pray for the Soul of Betty.\n\n"With all of my solo projects speeding up, we just felt it was time to move on," he said.\n\nThe singer said he is currently working on his solo debut and also has a development deal with ABC for a sitcom.

Hpv is a sexually trasmitted disease that is acually a curable disease. in most cases it will not stay with you for the rest of your life. in most cases it goes away on its on if you are being healthy. in some cases they can burn the cells off. your gyno can map out were those cells are exactly and choose the best method for you. Hpv has become a huge problem because they have not been able to detect it until about a year ago. and it causes cancer in wemon. if they have a shot for it, and your gyno says its the best for you, then try it. always ask what the side effects are.

I'm not a man. I have 5 tattoos on my body. They are in places where they can't be seen, except for the one on my ankle. Someone here called them tramp stamps. I'll have you know I am not a tramp, have never been one & never will. You people are all wet when it comes to some issues. Why should a woman be branded a tramp just because of tattoos. What if someone wanted her to get them, like her husband. I suppose he wanted her to be classified as a tramp. Grow up penis breath.........

I would say women suffer more than men, because they are paid less than men on average, they are burden with carrying children, they are more exploited than men (or by men). In other parts of the world, like third world and Eastern Bloc counties; Women are forced into prositution, forced abortions, if paid, paid very little, exploited by both the pimps and the "do-good" liberals to be "poster children", recieving nothing more than "moral" support and condemnation of their exploiters but the situation never gets allievated by the liberal tyranny of inaction. If not exploited by them, they are exploited by some corporation making 10 cents an hour at some factory. So, Women DO suffer much more than men. For those woman that can't stand on their own, it's the man's and humanity's responsibility to help them stand-up, giving them a hand-up, not a hand-out. (Liberals can't seem to grasp that concept.)

You're having oral sex therefore you are having sex. It's called oral SEX after all. If you don't want to have sex then don't even do the oral. It seems like a tease to me. You're all hot and bothered and oral is normally the lead into the sex. There is no in between so if you're not ready then don't have oral sex either.

As women age, the composition of the connective tissue in women's breasts naturally change from being a mix of fat and fibrous connective tissue to being more fatty and less fibrous. \nIts this same fibrous character that makes breasts of younger women tougher to see through on mammograms! Luckily not as many young women need 'em...\nAlso, there's a ligament (Cooper's suspensory ligament) that helps keep things "perky" when women are younger. ;-)\nLastly, good muscle tone in the chest (pectoralis) muscles helps to a certain extent. Most people lose some of this muscle tone as they age.\nDoes this answer your question?

Wild Turkeys live in open woodlands and forests with lots of clearings and meadows. They travel during the day looking for food.\n\nWild Turkeys eat a great variety of foods, including: insects, spiders, snails, slugs, salamanders, small lizards, small frogs, millipedes, grasshoppers, very small snakes, worms, grasses, vines, flowers, acorns, buds, seeds, fruits, clovers, dogwood, blueberries, cherries, hickory nuts, beechnuts, and other vegetation.\n\nWild Turkeys travel in small flocks. For most of the year, they are single-sex flocks. Females are with females, males with males. Young turkeys follow their mothers.\n\nWild Turkeys have good eyesight and hearing, and they are very fast runners.\n\nThe breeding season is in March and April. A male turkey will try to find a female flock to make his harem.\n\nTo attract females, the male will gobble and strut, fanning out his tail. He will mate with several females in the flock.\n\nWild Turkey nests are made in the ground. A shallow depression is lined with leaves and covered up with vines and other plants. Ten to fifteen eggs are laid. Eggs are light brown, with black and dark brown spots. The female will sit on the eggs for a month are more. This makes her very vulnerable to predators.

A protein is any of a large group of nitrogenous organic compounds that are essential constituents of living cells; consist of long strings of amino acids.\n\nThey are the polymers, with the condensation polymerisation of their subunits(amino acids), joined together by the amide linkage, and the bond is called a peptide bond.\n\nProteins have four types of structures:\nPrimary structure\nSecondary structure\nTertiary structure\nquartenary structure\n\nDue to the peptide bonding, proteins are also referred as polypeptides and are synthesised from the DNA.

Chavez is Fidel's little boy toy. Chavez sucks Fidel's thingie. When Chavez grows up, he wants to be just like Fidel, a communist pig, and murderer. Leading his country into starvation and poverty. Lying to the poor, the ignorant, and the hopeless of the nation to gain power, and then drill everyone to the ground. Venezuela will be, or already is, the next Cuba. The smart Venezuelans leave the country, and the poor mindless ones stay behind. It's history repeating itself, just like Cuba.
For the most part, because people are lazy. That's why you'll hear "I just have to accept the Lord, Jesus into my heart and that's all I need". Garbage like that, which they delude themselves into thinking is true, is simply their excuse for not doing what they need to be doing. You may also hear of their claims that they preach through their various car washes, bake sales, and etc...etc...they put on several times a year. It's more garbage. If anyone is claiming to be a Christian, then they MUST follow all of Jesus' commands for his Christian disciples, including that of preaching the good news of the kingdom from door-to-door and from town-to-town, wherever people are. \n\nIt's not simply a command that Jesus laid upon his followers, it's a Christian obligation to go out and preach about God's kingdom to other people.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses VOLUNTEER their time and effort to do just this very work, and as their annual reports show, their active 6.5 million members are putting in over 1 billion hours EACH YEAR to help others come to know the truth.

For me fortunately I was given another chance for it and I am able to do what I have should have done years ago. But I know that the road I did take was much harder that just trusting my instincts and intuition. I am glad that I still have the chance but now I can help to think that where would I have been now if I did what I was supposed to do then. Your question was pretty broad and I am not sure if this is something that you are personally going through now, but if you are I would say follow your heart and open yourself up to what you know what is right and trust what you be live. I know people who have not had the chance to do the things they should have done when the they had the chance and they regret it for the rest of their lives. You don't want to fall into that category. Try not to get stick singing a shoulda coulda woulda...

In a civil case, a wife can invoke what is called "the marital privilege." This is different from the right of a criminal defendant's spouse to refuse to testify all together, the "spousal immunity privilege." The "marital privilege" applies in both civil and criminal cases. The spouse still has to testify, but certain testimony will be priviledged. Here are the basics: \n1. All confidential communications are privilege. This mean no third party can be present (with the exception of children too young to understand).\n2. The parties must be married at the time the communication occurs. \n3. There is a split about whether actions observed by a spouse fit under the privelege (i.e. a wife witnesses her husband receiving stolen goods). This will be up to your individual jurisdiction. \n4. The privilege does not apply to suits between spouses.\n5. Only the spouses can claim the privilege.
Sex and love are not the same thing. Sex is not an extension of love. Sex is sex and love is love. When the two come together then its great but sex without love satisfies for a brief moment only.\n\nAnd... no having sex with you doesnt mean he loves you.

The Underground Railroad. \n\nImagine you are a slave in the South in 1850. You work six long, hard days a week, toiling in the fields of your master; it seems very unlikely that you'll ever be freed. Then, you hear from an old friend of yours who has escaped that he is now living in the North and wants you to join him in freedom. Do you dare? If you are caught the punishment will be severe, but if not, you can live in freedom.

There are very precise models for tsunami because water is much less "fluid" than air. Also, they move a lot faster so there is less time for outside interference to effect the tsunami.\n\nNow, while we can predict where a tsunami can hit, there is a large variability on the size of the tsunami. A 12 inch tsunami does not do much damage.
It only matters on who gets invited. The only bowl really affected directly are the National Championship and the Rose Bowl. This year there are about 25 bowl games that will be played and they are basically invite types of events. Many people argue that many teams that are not as good as others get invited just for ratings- for instance Nebraska on an offpeak year still goes to a bowl because people will watch. Of course this is for the sponsor to make $ on advertising.\n\nAlso many people argue that there are too many bowls. I personally say they are great revenue for the schools going to them so who cares how many there are...let the schools get the money.

Why Do Hindus Worship Many Gods?\n\nHuman beings through history have formulated many different names and forms for the Divine or Eternal. Just as we have many names and forms for other things, whether it is foods, or types of art, so too, in religion a similar great diversity has been created.\n\nThe Western world has prided itself in monotheism, the idea that there is only One God as the highest truth. Western religions have said that only the names and forms which refer to this One God are valid but those which appear to worship another God, or a multiplicity of divinities, must be false. They have restricted the names and forms they use in religious worship, and insist that only one set is true and correct and others are wrong or unholy. \n\nAs a universal formulation Hinduism accepts all formulations of Truth. According to the universal view there is only One Reality, but it cannot be limited to a particular name or form. Though Truth is One it is also Universal, not an exclusive formulation. It is an inclusive, not an exclusive Oneness - a spiritual reality of Being - Consciousness - Bliss, which could be called God but which transcends all names. The different Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism represent various functions of this One Supreme Divinity, and are not separate Gods. \n(Having many names for something is not necessarily a sign of ignorance of its real nature. On the contrary, it may indicate an intimate knowledge of it. For example, Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow in their language because they know snow intimately in its different variations, not because they are ignorant of the fact that all snow is only one. The many different deities of Hinduism reflect such an intimate realization of the Divine on various levels.)
They come here to seek a better life, that much I don't doubt. However, that doesn't make it right. I, myself, am an immigrant and I have several friends who are also immigrants. I, along with my friends, have come here through legal methods. The ones who continuously cross the borders are not. If they come here through the correct means then I don't have a problem with it. But with what they're doing now, it's a slap in the face to every immigrant who's had to come here lawfully.
Ultimate Fighting Championship started in the early 90's with fighters like Ken Shamrock and Royce (pronounced Hoyce) Gracie. It's a mixed martial arts full contact fighting event that up until 2 years ago could only be seen on Pay-per-view. You can watch the reality show "The Ultimate Fighter" on Spike TV. \nIf you've never seen it, it's well worth watching. It's addicting. Especially now, when boxing is soooo bad.

If you have Windows XP or Windows 2000, follow these steps:\n\n1. Take a backup. In case things get mucked up, you have something to go back to.\n\n2. Boot up your machine to Windows.\n\n3. Right-click on My Computer and click on Manage.\n\n4. In the left hand tab, click on disk management. The corresponding right hand tab would should you the disks you have installed along with partitions. The linux partition should be shown as "Unknown" or "Not Recognised". \n\n5. Right click on the Unknown partition and select "Format". This is the final frontier, and if you format the disk, there is no way going back to linux, (not easily anyway). \n\n6. Once format is done, assign a drive letter to it and the new drive with all its empty spaces should show up in your windows explorer.\n\n7. We are not done yet, assuming are using a boot loader (GRUB or LILO), you still have to remove that or you will be stuck at a LI or a grub> prompt. You may need the Windows XP/2000 CD, so keep that handy. \n\n8. Reboot, if you can see the boot loader, select Windows, and you should be fine.\n\n9. In case you cannot, boot with the CD and select the recovery mode. \n\n10. Once you get to the recovery console prompt, type "fdisk /mbr" and reboot once you get back the prompt.\n\n11. Enjoy Windows!!\n\nIf there is anything you do not understand above, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS AS IT MAY SCREW UP YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU MAY NEED PROFESSIONAL (READ COSTLY) HELP IN YOUR AREA. Better leave it to a local guru or have one handy atleast.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nYou should backup anything you think is valuable to you. It could be source code, photos, important lettes, documents, excel sheets, etc. etc. Basically whatever you cannot live without.
The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n"Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea

Ubuntu is pretty user-friendly, and it's Debian based so there is a vast base of software available for it. Fedora Core is the free development branch of Red Hat Linux, and my personal favorite. It also has large amounts of packaged software specifically targeted to it's users. Mandriva is one of the easiest and most foolproof installations, and is more targeted toward the not so techies out there. Debian, Gentoo, and Suse require a little more knowledge of the Gnu/Linux OS, but are very powerful distros once you get used to stuff like command line in a terminal and such. Whichever you choose to start with, just jump in there! It's all free or nearly free, and runs just fine on an old $50 or $75 P3 that you can get off of Craigslist (or find in the dumpster if you are lucky!). Download the ISO, burn the disc, and see how you like the distro. If you don't like one then install another. Ubuntu will even mail you the install CDs for free if you don't have a CD burner or a fast internet connection.

"Personnel" is an antiquated term for referring to what is now commonly called "Human Resources". The Human Resources department does not the decision on who should be hired or fired. This is usually left up to the department that the employee works in. Human Resoucres screen applicants for positions, ensure compliance with employment laws, administer training and development programs, manage employee benefits, and perform internal investigations (like sexual harassment claims). They also are involved in recruiting and they do research to ensure that their compensation programs are in line with the competition. They also maintain permanent records for all employees and are usually the ones that answer questions. They may also maintain the company's organizational chart and may maintain a database of the company's various jobs, their descriptions, and their performance requirements.

i almost have evidence against the hoax that Armstrong landed on moon.for reference i am placing a text version of the proof as the answer.i shall try to mail u the photographic evidence which i received from a friend.\n\n \n\n issue 1\nSince the Moon has only one light source, the Sun, the shadows must be in line. But in this cases, it looks as if there are multiple light sources in moon, which is not possible.\n \nIssue 2:\nThe foreground of many images of the astronauts on the Moon are filled in with light, while the shadows remain absolutely black, again proving that there are multiple light sources.\n\nIssue 3 :\nThere are no stars in the background from pictures taken on the Moon.\n \nIssue 4 : \nIn some images, a huge light source can be seen reflected in the astronaut's visors. This has to be a very bright, nearby source. There is no possibility of external light source in moon.\n \nISSUE 5 - How could NASA take TV images of the LM ascending on Apollo 15, 16, and 17 if there was no one on the Lunar surface to man the camera?\n \n\nISSUE 6 - There can't be any pictures taken on the Moon because the film would melt in the 250° temperatures. Any film exposed to 250° would indeed melt at that temperature.\n\nIssue-7 : The LM engine was very powerful. How come it did not leave a crater below the spacecraft? Why didn't it kick up any dust when it landed?\n\n \nissue 8: The footprints left by the astronauts are proof that the Moon landings are fake.\nThis one is also essentially a two pronged argument. First, the Fox show charged that the LM engine was so powerful that the upper layer of dust should have been blown away around the LM, so there should not be any footprints. Others have charged that the footprints should not be there since in the absence of water as a bonding agent, they should not maintain coherent shapes and sharp outlines.\n \n\n \nissue 9: There is no dust on LM footpads. -- According to Kaysing and Fox, this is the strongest evidence that the Moon landings are faked. They allege that with the swirling dust from LM descent engine, the foot pads should be covered with dust.\n \nissue 10 :\nThe pictures below show that flags are waving. And they never will. The flag was on the airless Moon, just as we all knew.\n\n \nTHERE ARE MANY MORE ISSUES ON THIS,\nBUT\nTHOSE ARE TOO TECHNICAL FOR US.\n \n…..NEIL ARMSTRONG WAS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO LAND ON MOON

Same reason that battle fatigues are in a variety of colors including browns - the striping is there to break up an outline, which it does admirably. Also, pattern recognition in many animals is for a specific form of predator/prey which gets obscured by the stripe pattern against a background. Color is actually of little interests since many animals don't see color.

I am assuming by "credit card imprint machine" you are referring to a manual imprinter and not a electronic credit card terminal - let me know if I am wrong. This makes a big difference in regards to the setup costs, since you do not have to purchase an expensive terminal. It does, however, also add a manual step in processing that will need to be properly managed. Also, all of your transactions will be considered "key entered" and you will be charged a higher rate. To be clear - if you do not process a card electronically, you will not receive the low rates that merchant processors quote in their marketing materials.\n\nYour best bet will be to start a dial-pay account. With this type of account, you will actually be imprinting the card and then calling in for approval for every card presented. This is actually a very quick process, but if you are doing a large amount of transactions, you should consider investing in a terminal.\n\nYour bank may seem like a very easy choice for processing. Unless it is a very large bank, though, they do not actually perform merchant processing services. It is more likely that they have been solicited by a merchant processor that won the bid for your banks customer leads and a certain portion of your fees will now go to your bank. The service and support, though, will be handled by the processor and your bank will not be involved.\n\nBe sure to consider the following:\n1.) As you will not be swiping cards for approval be very aware of the retail "card not present" and "key entered" rates that your processor assesses. \n\n2.) Be sure to know all of the different card rates. You will most likely receive debit cards, personal MC and Visa, Visa Rewards, MC World, and MC & Visa Corporate cards. Many processors sneak in a "nonqualified" rate for the Rewards, World and Corporate cards that can be upwards of 3%.\n\n3.) Be sure to work with a service oriented processor. Your method of processing will not be typical, so don't get stuck with a company that does not have a reputation for decent account management.\n\nYour key entered rates should start in the low 2.0% range and vary depending on card type.\n\nIf you would like more information about merchant processing, feel free to contact me at jbordeaux@windriverfinancial.c... or at (920)993-9433. Wind River is a merchant processor that specializes in offering well supported, competitively priced, custom processing services.

Every 15 minutes or so, look away from the book and focus on something far away for about 30 seconds. Our eyes are normally "binocular", and when we read, they become "monocular", focusing on one close thing. \n\nAlso, try this: Rub your hands together until they're warm. "Palm" your eyes--that is, place your hands over your eyes, but don't put pressure on them. Then imagine you're looking at something far, far away; you'll feel the focus changing in your eyes, while the heat will help relax the muscles around them.

It's very sad and traumatic when we lose someone we have known for that long. But to say that you wish you would have died with him is so wrong. Just imagine the sadness that your parents would have had to endure if they lost both a relative and a daughter. Grieving takes time and there are stages to it which include denial, anger, resentment, acceptance etc. Talk with your parents or a counsellor for a start and if you can go visit his grave site and talk with him and let him know that you are sad that he has passed and that you miss him greatly. But also tell him of the good things that you have planned and that you want to devote some of this goodness in his name. Hopefully his spirit will be present and you will leave the grave feeling much better after wards. Make your uncle and family proud and continue to live your life as a happy 14 year old, this is what your uncle would have wanted also. Good luck getting back on track.

I've known Muslims living in the US, they were not really any different than typical Americans. I am not sure if all Muslims are as devoted to their religion as the people I know are, but they did not push the religion in my face. We also shared a lot of views of life in general. \n\nI am currently reading the Quran to understand their religion a little more. So far it does seems for the most part peaceful. \n\nI do not like the fact that most of the ones I have spoken with online have a lot of discrimination against those who leave their religion it makes it look a bit like an cult, but other than that they seem well mannered, educated, and willing to share their knowledge.

This just proves how dysfunctional the bush administration has become. Years of corruption and cronyism has deteriorated our government to what we see today.\n\nFor the Bush administration to state that they had no idea that this would happen is a complete lie. The Times-Picayune did some great articles in 2002 about the unltimate hurricane. It accuratly predicted what happpened with Katrina.

He is refered to in the Bible by many names and symbolic ideas (IE: a rock, a lion, etc).\n\nThe two you mentioned represent aspects of his person. He is refered to as a lamb in the Bible because the lamb is the perfect sacrifice. He is refered to as the shephard because He leads the flock (His church) like sheep. \n\nHope this helps.

Not sure exactly what you want but.....What is the best sound insulator or maybe which materials are the best conductor/insulator of heat/electricity. Woodlice are a good subject how they huddle together, how they head for a dark dampish place the way they respire through their body parts(not sure which part) How they obtain nutrition and water,\nOr how about developing a mould on different foods what delays the Development(Cold and Dry) What speeds up the development (warmth and moisture) Chemically changing a piece of bread for example burning it into toast will mean the uncooked bread will develop mould quickest.

They earned these past two premiership titles, but I see the window of their dominance closing quickly, as in next year might be their last year. Their downfall is, surprisingly, going to be their depth and ignorance. Chelsea has the MOST stocked midfield in European football. Because of this great young players have missed out on developing like Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole, who are crucial for England's National Team success in the future. These players would be starters on any other team and they will eventually leave to get their starting gigs. And Jose Mourinho will get canned next year after another dissapointing Champions League exit and his refusal to sign a world-class striker and stay with an immensely inferior Drogba. Also Man U and Arsenal are developing some great YOUNG teams.

Not really. It depends on the way you will say it and how close you are to the person. I agree with you, most people doesnt want to admit mistakes but mature ones are open to it because they know it what makes them strong.

One reason, I believe, is because they have gotten more organized and more open in thier ways. I know that many right-wing conservatives are connected with Christian religions. I also know that many churches in the past election handed out election materials to their congregations and some preached that it was a moral necessity to vote for the right-wing conservative. The TV evangelists were especially strong on this, but I know people who said that even in the Catholic church they preached the "rightness" of those who opposed abortion.\n\nAs a whole, the left-wing balance is not as organized. And it has become complacent in the past (meaning they do not tend to vote as much). \n\nI also know that, as a country, we tend to swing back and forth, like a pendelum. So the more the right-wing conservatives gain power, the more vocal those in the opposite corner, and many in the middle ground become, and we eventually reach a pivot point where we cycle again toward the middle.\n\nIMHO (in my humble opinion)
Please calm down. Men like their space. We women bring a lot of emotions into a relationship men are not the same. Give him his space. If you have doubts then confront him.

Slim Jim,\nYou can get 100% financing and typically have the seller contribute up to 3% of the selling price of the house to your closing costs. The only requirement would be that you'd have to have $500 of your own money into the transaction.\n\nThe interest rates are very comparable to 80% or less financing; there is a .5% charge 97% & 100% financing (usually an 1/8 or 1/4 more in interest rate).\n\nThe tough part at the high LTV's can be mortgage insurance.\n\nThe ways around this is:\n1. VA programs and paying the funding fee (good deal)\n2. 80/20 loans, usually a savings in payments over MI\n3. Community Mortgage programs -- This is a great secret that most of us lenders have available. If you take a home buying/home owning course I have programs that I can offer that have reduced MI. The savings can be big.\n\nSearch for My Community Mortgage programs, or if in FL feel free to email me, and I'll work with you.\n\nHope this helps,\nChris

I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an "authentic" rock and roll band. When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch. I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that. Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands. I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll. It's edgy. And they are a really good live act. Of course this is all my opinion. But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself.
Undoubtedly one of the hottest areas of debate in discussions between Christians and Muslims is the Christians dogma of the Trinity. Almost invariably, Muslims are convinced that Christians believe in three, separate deities, whilst Christians are adamant in affirming their absolute commitment to monotheism. Without question, the concept of the Triune deity - indeed, the whole doctrine of God - is difficult to understand, but this difficulty is unnecessarily accentuated if an uninformed or incorrect view of Christian dogma is held by Muslims. The purpose of this paper is to set the record straight, and also to compare and contrast aspects of the doctrine of God in both religions.........
I am a Christian. And my answer is no. I have studied God's Word and continue to do so and the most important teachings of Yeshua/Jesus are to love your enemy, do good to those who persecute you, return evil with kindness. Love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind and love your neighbor as yourself. \nAs a Christian we are warned that in the last days there will be many "false prophets" and we will know them "by their fruit" (the results of their actions). And as Christians, we hope for a Christian leader. But we must not be blind to the possibility that a politician would dishonestly "court" the Christian vote when it is their only way to get elected.

As far as I know, there are no mathematical colleges. I think Waterloo University in Canada has a Faculty of Mathematics.

Some have departments of statistics, applied statistics, applied probability and probability in addition.

First of all, do you like any of them. If you do then it might be problematic if the 4 of you dont sit down and discuss whats up. If you dont like them then at some point you will have to tell them how you feel. They certainly have made it obvious to you how they feel. The more important issue is to keep the friendship first; That is what all 4 of you need to look at. Sit down and make sure that the 4 of you understand that at the end of the day you want to be each others best friend. Now there is no guarantee that can happen. What can be said is that by talking it out you know how everyone feels about the situation.
I think you just tell the company who holds your IRA that you are wanting to buy a home and you would like to use your money in your IRA to put a nice down payment on one & they should be able to fill out a 1099 form (i think that is what they call that form-it is either 1099 or 1098) showing that that money is not taxable income.

jon e carcin might have hit it right on target. If you guys have an intimate relationship and sharing things as married couples do then there might not be any motivation to get married. Additionally, there have been scars along the way that might have affected him and you. Hopefully, you both have had some inner healing.\n\nIt might be time to have a dinner with your sweetie and talk about your relationship and the future. Be gentle but at the same time find out if there is a future together. If there is still doubt then you both might have to take a rest from each other for a little while. During this rest do not date or see other guys. This is about your relationship.\n\nAlso, successful women might affect a guys ego if he feels the need to take care of you but you don't need to be taken care of. He might not understand a sharing of a relationship and could be more used to a dependant relationship. \n\nHere is a idea. Why not read a good book together such as:\n\nBook: Becoming Soul Mates\nAuthor: Dr. Les Parrott III, Dr. Leslie Parrott \nISBN: 0310219264 \n\nI wish you both the best of luck. \n\nBlessings

Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский Igor' Fëdorovič Stravinskij) (June 17, 1882 – April 6, 1971) was a Russian-born composer of modern classical music. He composed in the primitivist, neo-classical and serialist styles, but he is best known for three works from his earlier, Russian period: Le sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Petrushka and L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). For some, these daring and innovative ballets practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to piano miniatures.\n\nStravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of "expressing anything but itself". Robert Craft transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as Conversations with Stravinsky.\n\nA quintessentially cosmopolitan Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the West and in his native land. He was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the century.\n\nStravinsky was born in Oranienbaum (now Lomonosov), near St. Petersburg, Russia. Brought up in St. Petersburg and dominated by his father and elder brother, Stravinsky's early childhood was a mix of experience that hinted little at the cosmopolitan artist he was to become. Although his father Fyodor Stravinsky was a bass singer at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Stravinsky originally studied to be a lawyer. He switched to composition later. In 1902, at the age of 20, Stravinsky became the pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, probably the leading Russian composer of the time.\n\nStravinsky left Russia for the first time in 1910, going to Paris to attend the premiere of his ballet L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). During his stay in the city, he composed two further works for the Ballets Russes—Petrushka (1911) and Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring) (1913). The ballets trace his stylistic development: from the L'oiseau de feu, whose style draws largely on Rimsky-Korsakov, to Petrushka's emphasis on bitonality, and finally to the savage polyphonic dissonance of Le Sacre du printemps. As Stravinsky noted about the premieres, his intention was "[to send] them all to hell". (He succeeded: the 1913 première of Le sacre du printemps was probably the most famous riot in music history).\n\nStravinsky displayed an inexhaustible desire to learn and explore art, literature, and life. This desire manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only was he the principal composer for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, but he also collaborated with Pablo Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927) and George Balanchine (Apollon Musagete, 1928).\n\nRelatively short of stature and not conventionally handsome, Stravinsky was nevertheless photogenic, as many pictures show. He was still young when, on 23 January 1906, he married his cousin Katerina Nossenko whom he had known since early childhood. Their marriage endured for 33 years, but the true love of his life, and later his partner until his death, was his second wife Vera de Bosset (1888-1982). Although a notorious philanderer (even rumoured to have affairs with high-class partners such as Coco Chanel), Stravinsky was also a family man who devoted considerable amounts of his time and expenditure to his sons and daughters. One of his sons, Soulima Stravinsky, was also a composer, but is little known compared to his father.\n\nWhen Stravinsky met Vera in the early 1920s, she was married to the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin, but they soon began
Read the article I wrote: "Is the Housing Bubble Real?" http://burlingamerealtor.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/2006/02/16.html\n\nI suggest reading "Are You Missing The Real Estate Boom?" by David Lereah\n\nReal Estate prices can't go to zero, unless there was a reason for people to flee that area or the interest rates shot up suddenly and much higher than what we could imagine, whatever the size of that area. It's not likely that interest rates will shoot up quickly. So ask yourself if the people of the area you are thinking about have a reason to leave the area suddenly.\n\nIf they don't, then there will likely be no real estate bubble in that area. \n\nReal Estate is not a short term investment and it's not as liquid as stocks. Stocks can go to zero but it's EXTREMELY difficult for real estate to go to zero.\n\nThe real estate bubble scare has been brought upon by stock brokerages and/or the media since they are tied together or invest in each other. Don't buy into it.\n\nReal Estate is a finite commodity. However, stock shares can be split forever it seems. Also real estate is unique, even if it's in the same complex, if a condo. Is each share of the same stock unique? No, one share of MSFT, for example, is exactly like another share of MSFT! \n\nSo in my opinion, yes real estate can drop by 10%, 15% or 20% but I wouldn't call it a bubble. The price will likely come back up in time, unless the area has been cursed forever. For less risk, buy in an area that's got potential, is near good schools, near shops, near transportation, has a good real estate history and near jobs.\n\nMy strongest suggestion if you are serious in buying is to speak to a good Realtor, (go to http://www.ReferredPro.com) to be referred to one, who can give you some guidance, especially since they work with lots of people in your shoes who are thinking the same thing and lots of others who are making money in real estate. Warning: friends don't necessarily give the best advice, even when they think they are.

aretus60,\n\nI really admire your courage to ask for help here, and I was surprised to see that you received quite a few answers that were compassionate and caring. I really want to help you, but there’s nothing that I can do. You have to talk to Jesus yourself.\n\nIf you ever knew God, you need to repent (change your direction) and ask Jesus to save you all over again. If you have never done it, you need to understand that you have made mistakes. Then, ask Jesus to forgive you, and tell Him that you will gladly follow Him. If you do that, and mean it from your heart, He will do His part and save you.\n\nDon’t trust in a religious upbringing; don’t trust in what you were taught. Talk to Jesus and trust only in Him.\n\nAfter you have done that, please read my newsletter for May on my Yahoo! 360 page. It will give you some wisdom about dealing with the drinking and partying and anything else that you are struggling with. \n\nSomeone has been praying for you, and I have prayed for you, too.\n\nGod bless.
When I was 15, I worked as a chambermaid at a motel near my house. You make an hourly rate plus tips, and you can control the length of your workday to some extent. For example, if it was a hot, sunny day and we wanted to go to the beach, we busted our azzes and cleaned really quickly to get out of there, and if it was rainy or something, we took our time and stretched out our hours, working longer and making another hour or two's wage.
Depends how you define "first." Columbia was the first to fly in space. Enterprise was the first to fly at all (glide testing) but was never finished for spaceflight; it was also used for "fit checks" at the launch pads. The construction of Challenger started before that of Columbia, even though it was the second one to fly in space.

Yes, actually that is very true. Also, another part of the body that never stops growing is the bone above your eyes where your eyebrows are. Also, the skull at the back of your head. That is why a lot of human skulls from several thousand years ago have long looking heads and big brows that cause them to look ape like. It turns out it is just men that have lived up to 900 yrs of age. One of the most famous skeletons ever found that evolutionists claimed to be a link between ape and man was just a human in this 900 yr age range. The man just had extremely bad osteoporosis causing him to have a major hunch back and then the skull had the same shape I mentioned above. These features made evolutionists believe it was an ape starting to walk up right like humans. All along it was just a pour old man that lived to long! Thank God that He doesn't allow us to live that long now.

These offenders are clearly in violation of public decency and also under the influence of being lame. Such punishments must match the offense. Therefore I would like to put forth a bill that would make such lewd acts not only criminal but a federal felony and would make the offenders candidates for the death sentence. We also must take precausions and make sure that these people not be allowed to reproduce and possibly influence the next generation to act like whiggers.

"...was a Danish (Scanian) nobleman astronomer as well as an astrologer and alchemist\n\nHe is credited with the most accurate astronomical observations of his time, and the data was used by his assistant Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion. No one before Tycho had attempted to make so many redundant observations, and the mathematical tools to take advantage of them had not yet been developed. He did what others before him were unable or unwilling to do — to catalogue the planets and stars with enough accuracy so as to determine whether the Ptolemaic or Copernican system was more valid in describing the heavens."

a hicky is caused by sucking, the blood raises to the surface of the skin, which causes the skin to look bruised and discolored. There are rumors that you could possibly get tumors or blood clots from this however there is no need to worry because they cannot cause cancer. cancer is a disease, it is caused by low production of white blood cells that help your body fight of infections and bacteria. Most people who have cancer die because of some other illness before they die of the actual cancer itself. So you see it may be quite impossible for a hickey to change the white blood cell count in your body.....

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I find most attractive is not the same thing as other people. And the other way around too, you will know. But in the mean time, it could be that you should be a little bolder too possibly. Are you showing interest in others too? Or just waiting for someone else to make the move on you?

Generally, an easement giving access to your property cannot be blocked under any circumstances. Any lawyer in your area who specializes in real estate law will know and can assist, or the real estate agent who sold you your property. \n\nYou can also contact the city councilmember or county supervisor who represents your area for assistance. The county administrator's office where you live will be able to tell you who best to contact. \n\nA county land assessor/surveyor will be able to establish the property lines for each of you, and you might be able to look up the easement information as part of public record. \n\nAlthough the easement may be on your neighbor's property, ownership does not give them the right to block access, and their property deed probably details what can or cannot be done with the easement. \n\nThe quicker you take action the better, as waiting can sometimes be contstrued as your silent acceptance of what your neighbor is doing. Easement problems can be very difficult, and it is best to get help as soon as possible. Good luck!

I don't know, can it be due to predatory economic policies? \nCan it be because of a history of using covery CIA missions to destabilize governents and our support of right wing dictators ? \nCan it be because of our own political ineptitude and near sighted foreign policies? Can it be becasue of the way we exploit the natural resources of countries that have corrupt governments ? \nLosing ? Maybe that is too optimistic an assessment.

I do believe in a higher power than myself... things are put together all too well to not have some force behind it. My problem is with organized religion. You don't have to go to a church to be in god's house just walk outside that is the house that was created for us. Think about the savage acts that we carried out "in the name of god" the crusades, 9/11, ect. ect. it goes on through out history. I personally don't believe that this is what the higher power had intended. That is my "issue" with god and I would imagine that I am not the only one.

Well if you're speaking about Antonio Gramsci (January 22, 1891 – April 27, 1937), he was an Italian writer, politician, leader and theorist of Socialism, Communism and Anti-Fascism.\nA brilliant student, Gramsci won a prize that allowed him to study at the University of Turin, where he read literature. He found Turin at the time going through a process of industrialization, with the Fiat and Lancia factories recruiting workers from poorer regions. Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge. Gramsci had a close involvement with these developments, frequenting socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants, which gave him continuity with his native culture.\n\nHis early difficult experiences in Sardinia had already shaped his view of the world. This, together with his experience on the mainland, had a part in his decision to join the Italian Socialist Party.\n\nHe became a notable journalist, even if his writings were mainly for political papers such as L'Avanti (the Socialist Party official organ); nevertheless his brilliant prose and his intelligent observations soon resulted in greater fame.\nAn articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci produced a great deal of writing as editor of a number of socialist newspapers in Italy. Among the many, with Palmiro Togliatti he set up (in 1919) L'Ordine Nuovo (also the name of an unrelated 1960s fascist group), and contributed to La Città Futura.\n\nOn the evening of November 8, 1926, Gramsci was arrested in Rome and, in accordance with a series of "Exceptional Laws" enacted by the fascist-dominated Italian legislature, committed to solitary confinement at the Regina Coeli prison. This began a ten-year odyssey, marked by almost constant physical and psychic pain as a result of a prison experience that culminated, on April 27, 1937, in his death from a cerebral hemorrhage. No doubt the stroke that killed him was but the final outcome of years and years of illnesses that were never properly treated in prison.\nYet as everyone familiar with the trajectory of Gramsci's life knows, these prison years were also rich with intellectual achievement, as recorded in the Notebooks he kept in his various cells that eventually saw the light after World War II, and as recorded also in the extraordinary letters he wrote from prison to friends and especially to family members!
President Schwarzenegger triggered World War 3.

Governor Schwarzenegger never made a speech there last year. OH MY GOD! I'm the only one that remembers the other time line. They will be coming for me soon.\n\nSee you on The Island.

Hmm. I am assuming you are writing this from the perspective of living in America? It isn't quite that bad here in UK...yet.\nI do not like the way that marriage, which is a religious ceremony - and as such, should have NOTHING to do with LAW(!) - is required for certain reasons beyond the joining of two people whom are in love.\nI would welcome the separation of marriage and law and would welcome the rewriting of vows as the only thing I can say about anything to do with religion these days is that it keeps people apart, forces sides, promotes insecurity and false hopes and least of all...is the cause of most wars in the land.
As you suggest, it was used in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. It is used to refer to a time where people were younger and far more carefree. It always reminded me of the deliciousness of the early spring crop of vegetables in Italy, especially. Each vegetable is so sweet and delicious that any melange seemed like a banquet and they practically required no seasoning, perhaps just a bit of steam and some cold pressed olive oil. Hence I see salad days as that which is youthful, fresh, filled with flavor and the innocence by which youth will always be oblivious of the hardships and heavy responsibilities yet to come.

First, the fighting in Ireland is not between Catholics and Protestants. It is between people who want to remain part of Britian, and those who want independence. The majority of those who want to remain part of England are members of the English church. While those who want indepence are mre often cathlic (non-Church of England). But the fightings is not religion based. It is entirely political.\n\nAs to why fighting happens between people who claim to worship the same God, it happens for the same reason that any war does. The people involved have difference they can not settle any other way. Sometimes they actually are about religion. Most often they are about land (who gets Israel) or power (who rules Ireland) or money (who get the oil). Religion is simply a good motivator to get people into a fight that they might not do otherwise (They will kill to get rid of "insert religion" fanatics before they will kill to get oil)\n\nWhy does God permit it? If you mean permit as in support or encourage it, he doesn't. War between his people is a sin, and those who deliberate stir up should fights will be punished for it in the end.\n\nIf you mean permit, as in why does he not stop it...I would ask you how? If when Hitler and Nazis had first started their march on Europe, God had come through with a death angel and struck them all down, can you imagine that uproar there would have been against him? Many would have been calling God evil and murderous for slaughtering thousands of innocents. Look at all the charges leveled against God for his actions against Pharoah in the days of Moses, with the ten plagues. All intended to stop the murder, enslavement and abuse of nearly 3 million people. But seen by many as an evil act.\n\nGod has stopped wars in the past. He has used plagues to take down armies. He has used natural disasters to wipe out evil nations. He has used revolts and riots to take out unjust rulers and governments. He has used armies to stop evil and aggression. He can and will use whatever force is needed.\n\nBut he most often uses the power of love, help, support, giving, and good to change lives rather then destroy them. To bring peace, not war. That is the only way that will work.

My husband is an analyst. He gets up usually around 5-5:30 AM, makes coffee for me, lets the dogs out, brings the coffee up to me and checks our personal stocks on one computer and turns on his laptop to check out what is happening at work. He sits on his laptop watching transportaion flows all over the US, checks weather to determine whether that will have an impact on shipments, answers e mails, his cell phone and pagers to solve problems and feeds the dogs between 8:30 and 9:00AM.\n\nThen he gets back on his computer and does the same thing until about noon when he takes his shower, asks me to help him pick out a tie for the suit and shirt he's wearing that day, packs up his laptop and goes into the office.\n\nWhile at work, he trains people on the programs that they are not using correctly, procedures they are not following and makes presentations about the same. He also does evaluations and follow-up reports on large accounts that include suggestions and recommendations on what could have been done better and what was done well. \n\nThen around the time Oprah comes on, he calls me to ask if there is anything he needs to pick up at the market so I can make dinner, stops by the market and comes home around 6:00-6:30 PM to a wonderful delicious gourmet dinner. \n\nHe is, however, on 24 hour call so often has to answer his cell or return calls if there are any emergencies. Usually, we take a spa after dinner, put on our jammies, watch some TV and go to bed around 9:00-9:30PM. Oh, we let out the doggies before retiring.\n\nHe's worked for his company for 40 years since he was in high school, is well compensated and really loves his job.

Everyone who said the Braves is correct. They have actually reached the postseason every year from 1991 to 2005, except for 1994. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody made the postseason in '94 because of the strike. But the Braves can still claim 14 straight division titles.

Joining the Air Force was the best thing that I ever did with my life. I was 20 years old, failing college, living with my parents, hardly making any money, and watching all of my friends do things with their lives..so I finally decided to do something with mine. My family comes from a big military background as well and it was an easy decision for what branch to go into such as the Air Force. The military in general is not for everyone. Its a big lifestyle change that you will need to become assumed to. You're parents are naturally scared because they love you and don't want you to get hurt, which the chances of that happening with you in the Air Force depending on what career field you get, are slim to none. The Air Force is a GREAT way to meet to friends that you'll keep for life, get an education, see the world, make an honest paycheck, and be a part of an organization that you can feel proud to be in. Looks great on a resume if you decide to get out in four years as well. You're YOUNG and time is on your side, I know four years sounds like a really long time but it goes by SO fast. I wish you the best of luck in whatever you choose to do.
If you get a prescription from your doctor, it's around $35. On the net it's more like $80. If you really need to lose weight a doctor will have no problem prescribing it for you. If you don't, why do you want it? The side effects are sucky--insomnia, hot flashes, dizziness, thirst, dry mouth. (I'm on it right now.)\nYou can go to the phentermine web site and look at their prices and then call some local pharmacies and see the difference.
excercise eventually decreases the heart rate because the heart gets better conditioned and pumps more efficiently. Certain medications decrease the heart rate by blocking the stimulation areas of the heart (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers). other medicines stimulate the heart and make it beat faster. Disease can increase the heart rate if it makes the heart have to work harder to pump the blood around, or decrease it if it's things like a heart attack (affecting the heart rate generating area, or the path of the signal) or some electrolyte distrubaces or over medication.

Painkillers can become severely habit forming, especially if you have been taking them for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.) You can try to wean yourself off of the pills slowly, reducing your dosage gradually or increase the time period between doses. This will be a process that takes place over time. You will still have to take the pills, and it could be a while before you get off of them, but you won't crack up from withdrawl!\n\n3.) You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try. Check out your local GNC for some hep if you want to avoid the doctor.

Jesus is alive according to the Quran, for the Qur'an relates: \n\nThey [unbelievers] planned and God planned. But God is the best of planners. (Surah Al 'Imran, 3:54)\n\nAs the verses reveal, they plotted and moved to kill Jesus. However, their plot failed and they ended up killing a look-alike. During this event, God raised Jesus up to His presence: \n\nAnd [on account of] their saying: "We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Messenger of God." They did not kill him and they did not crucify him, but it was made to seem so to them. Those who argue about him are in doubt about it. They have no real knowledge of it, just conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him. God raised him to Himself. God is Almighty, All-Wise. (Surat An-Nisa', 4:157-158)\n\nThe reality revealed in the verses is clear. The Romans, abetted by some Jews' agitation, attempted to kill Jesus but did not succeed. The expression "but it was made to seem so to them" reveals this fact. God showed them a look-alike and raised Jesus up to His presence. Our Lord also reveals that those who made that claim had no knowledge of the truth. \n\nExamining the words used in the narratives relating how the Prophets died and the verses dealing with Jesus' ascent to God's presence reveals an important fact: Jesus did not die like the other prophets did, nor was he murdered by the unbelievers. Rather, our Lord took him up to His presence.\n\nYou can find more information in here :\n\nhttp://www.jesuswillreturn.com/s1_4.html

Yes, blind people do dream. What they see in their dreams depends on how much they could ever see. If someone has been totally blind since birth, they only have auditory dreams. If someone has had a measure of sight, then that person dreams with that measure of sight. Those individuials who have had some sight before they went blind can dream as though they can see, colors included. \n\nIN all fairness, one should first look at what a dream is.. really.. this must be understood before the question could be fully answered. The word "dream" has four interrelated meanings that follow one from another. When we put them altogether, we know what a dream is. \n\nFirst, a "dream" is a form of thinking that occurs when (a) there is a certain, as yet undetermined, minimal level of brain activation, and (b) external stimuli are blocked from entry into the mind, and (c) the system we call the "self system" (the "I," the "me") is shut down.\n\nSecond, a "dream" is something we "experience" because the thinking is very real and makes use of our senses -- especially seeing and hearing; because usually we are the main actor; and because a dream is sometimes very emotional (but not always). \n\nThird, a "dream" is what we remember in the morning, so it is "a memory" of the dreaming experience. \n\nFourth, a "dream" can also mean the spoken or written "report" we give to others about that experience, which is the only way anyone else can ever know about another person's dreams (because they can't be seen by others or told about by us while they are happening). \n\nSO....in summation (keeping in mind what dreams are),\n\nThere are no visual images in the dreams of those born without any ability to experience visual imagery in waking life. \n\nIndividuals who become blind before the age of five seldom experience visual imagery in their dreams, there has been reports some visual imagery in six schoolchildren who lost their sight before age five. \n\nThose who become sightless between the ages of five and seven may or may not retain some visual imagery. \n\nMost people who lost their vision after age seven continue to experience at least some visual imagery, although its frequency and clarity often fade with time.

That works, but you need to add the latent heat of fusion required to make the ice into water. You can do the e=smt where e is the energy required (in J), s is the specific heat of ice(2100 J/kg per degree C), m is the mass of ice (kg), and t is the change in temp (C).\n\ne=(2100)(.1)(20)\ne=4200 J\n\nThen to make it into water, you need to do e=ml, there e is the energy required (J), m is the mass (kg), and l is the laternt heat of fusion (about 3.3 x 10^5 J/kg for water).\n\ne=(.1)(3.3 x 10^5)\ne=33000 J\n\nThen add the two e's together to ge a total\n\ne=37200 J

The rate of return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date. YTM is considered a long-term bond yield expressed as an annual rate. The calculation of YTM takes into account the current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity. It is also assumed that all coupons are reinvested at the same rate. Sometimes this is simply referred to as "yield" for short.\n\nTo calculate it, you can use the YIELD function in Excel. (Go to Tools>Add ins and select Analysis Toolpak if the function is not listed). This function essentially determines what rate is needed to discount the future cash flows of the bond to make the present value equal to the current price.

First, I'll describe a scenario in which cell phones might be expected to cause some damage, using skin cancer as an example, and then I'll review some of the scientific work that has tried to examine this scenario.\n\nThe short answer is, as far as we know, no, cell phone usage can't cause damage to your ears or brain. It has been known for a long time that certain environmental conditions are associated with higher rates of cancer, though. These conditions have led to changes in behavior, since we would all like to avoid cancer.\n\nTake exposure to sunlight. A bronze tan used to be associated with health and vigor. Now it is thought to be healthiest to put on sunscreen because overexposure to the sun's rays is linked to various skin cancers. How does that cancer happen? The sun's rays are a form of energy, which can have different effects on skin. Immediately (and pleasantly), that energy is noticed in the form of heat as our skin warms up. A bit more exposure and the skin changes its pigment (that is, it tans), which changes the amount of sunlight absorbed.\n\nBut repeated, long-term exposure has been shown to be damaging. It turns out that the increased energy, every once in a while, can actually break or change the bonds of some of the molecules that make a skin cell work. Most of the time, these breaks are harmless—the cell just dies, the break is repaired, or it makes no difference because the place where the break occurred isn't all that important.\n\nSometimes, though, the change brought about by the increased energy (coming from the sunlight) is the sort of break that changes the way something in the cell functions—a real mutation. All skin cells normally go through a cycle where they wait for a while, then replicate, and then die. The signal to die is a carefully regulated process that's an important way to make sure we don't end up with old, sick cells (cell death of this kind is usually called apoptosis). If there is a cell with a mutation in the part of the cell's blueprint (the DNA) for the pathway that controls the signals to die, you end up with a cell that may just think it should go on living forever.\n\nAt first glance, that doesn't sound so bad. But what if this same cell also decided to keep on replicating? Each cell that replicated would also live forever and keep replicating forever. You'd end up with a fast-growing immortal bunch of cells, more commonly known as a tumor.\n\nBut what do tumors have to do with cell phones? Well, it turns out that cell phones are quite similar to the sun in that they also emit energy—that's how they can send our conversations over long distances. And while the sun is much stronger, it's also much farther away. So if we hypothesize that the energy from cell phones will be harmful, one thing we can look for is the presence of tumors—either skin tumors on the ears or brain tumors. We can also expose animals to the type of energy that cell phones emit and see if they do worse than animals that haven't had that exposure.\n\nLet's see what scientists have found:\n\nStudy 1: In 2003, a group of British scientists exposed bacteria (special ones that were similar to human brain cells) to energy similar to that emitted by cell phones and found no difference between them and unexposed bacteria. This is a pretty good direct test of our hypothesis.\n\nStudy 2: In 2004, a group in Italy looked at the sorts of damage that usually occur when cells are exposed to large amounts of energy. They found that cells exposed to cell-phone-like energy did not show more damage than cells that weren't exposed.\n\nStudy 3: A group in Sweden showed in 2004 that there was no link between cellular or cordless telephones and tumors in the mouth in human

Hi there,\n\nI'm a historian and I focus on ancient history. I can tell you that the 10 lost tribes were taken out of the Northern Israelite Kingdom, known as Samria in the early 8th century BC. This is when the Assyrian Armies captured Samaria, not only is this documented in history but in the bible as well. I think it's in I Kings. \n\nAnyway, after the Assyrian conquest, the 10 tribes were scattered throughout the eastern portion of the Assyrian Empire by King Sargon. From this point on it appears that they took the name Scythians (or Kuthia in Persian). However, there's no real proof of the name-change. It is well known however, that historically speaking they ceased to be a people after the Assyrian conquest, and other peoples were relocated to Samaria from throughout the Empire to populate Samaria. These new people, not at all related to the Jews that still lived in Judea. \nI hope this helps you. God bless!
It's very likely although mostly, you'd just feel ill and stop eating (if you were smart, hopefully). In extreme cases, if you kept eating or were being forced to keep eating, it's also possible that your stomach could rupture or that your asophagus could swell up from the strain its being put on. Either way, its not a pretty picture. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie SE7EN but.. yea. It's gross.

I think it is presumptuous to ask a French university to teach in English. Why not simply go to an English or American university? There are probably universities in Canada, at least in Quebec, that have both English and French classes, as that province is determinedly bilingual.\n\nOr is there an American or English university in France? I know there have been such things in the past.

this question take us to the cause of gravitational force, acco0rding to Einstein the time-space cojunction is bended nearby mases, and of course it is bended more near the higher mases. so when ane body fall in the time-space bendind for another mass it will be forced to take certain tracks by time-space bending so it begin to rotate in an ecliptical tracks arround the other body (like earth orbiting the sun). the principle of equivalence says that also light is forced to take certain tracks too near by masses for the same reason, this principle was proofed in 1919 during a famous solar eclipse, they observed some stars in the day near the eclipted sun and found that its position was little shifted (indeed the comming light from these stars curved by the mass of the sun) and this causes a famous astronommical phenomena called Gravitational Lenses which you can find some photos and comments about it in Internet.\ni hope that i could give you the benefit, Regards.

It would really depend on the nature of the crime. \n\nIf it was a felony dwi over ten years ago, and the nurse has been sober and a twelve stepper since, the answer would be yes.\n\nIf it were a case of felony manslaughter, where the conviction was classified as a felony because of martial arts training, and/or where either self-defense or defense of an innocent was a factor, the answer would be yes.\n\nOff the top of my head, I really can't think of any other crime that wouldn't always leave me wondering about the nurse's use of judgement or intention.
Anime (アニメ) is a style of cartoon animation originating in Japan. Anime is characterized by character and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers. Storylines may feature a variety of characters and may be set in different locations and in different eras. Anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different genres that any series may be categorised under. Anime may be broadcast on television, distributed on media, such as DVDs, or published as console and computer games. Anime is often influenced by Japanese comics known as manga. Anime may also be adapted into live action television programs.\n\nSome of the cartoon I've seen really are quite artistically dead, but at the same time some of the magazine anime and video anime are avant garde...\n\nso I can't say I'm whole heartedly behind this movement, but can agree to having seen anime dubbed in English.\n\nso the answer would be D

The universe is not a vacuum since it obviously has stuff in it (us for example), but there are places in the universe that are pretty close to being totally devoid of any matter.\nAll the material in the universe is attacted to all the other meterial in the universe through gravity. The matter in the universe has gravitated towards each other forming planets, stars, galaxies, ... leaving a lot of empty space. All this empty space is a vacuum, since by definaition, a vacuum is devoid of matter, empty.\n\nYou can ignore the fact that a true, total vacuum does not exist, not even is space.

Maybe. It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process. The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again. This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks. What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish. So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate. But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world. If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that. I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me. \n\nSo, it makes sense. It works, if you work it. What are the drawbacks? I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things. I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups. They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \n\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility. Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you. In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you. When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them. In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs. MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education. \n\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs. Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else. It's a way to level the playing field. \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck
protein needs training to function well on the muscle, and creation works as a power enhancer that gives u higher performance in gym ...\n\nI tried both, and i gained 10 kilos after using them in 3 month. You have to watch out for the recommandations and know what to use according to your condition.\n\nBut yet for weight gain i suggest whey proteins, and creatin wait untill u need to push more in gym start taking it, and for more effective result there is some kind of proteins that work in making the muscle keep its new size and not lose it if u had to stop gym for a while (maybe such stuff might be added with the creatin you are using)\n\nOne last note: dont use liquid creatin its not effective at all, and its having defects.

KGB is the Russian-language acronym for State Security Committee, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti).\n\nFrom March 13, 1954 to November 6, 1991 KGB was the umbrella organisation name for:\n\n * the principal Soviet security agency;\n\n * the principal intelligence agency;\n\n * the principal secret police agency.\n\nRoughly, the KGB's operational domain encompassed functions and powers like those exercised by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the counterintelligence (internal security) division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Protective Service, and the Secret Service.\n\nIn March 1953, Lavrenty Beria consolidated the MVD and the MGB into one body--the MVD; within a year, Beria was executed and MVD was split. The re-formed MVD retained its police and law enforcement powers, while the second, new agency, KGB, assumed internal and external security functions, and was subordinate to the Council of Ministers. On July 5, 1978 the KGB was re-christened as the "KGB of the Soviet Union", with its chairman holding a ministerial council seat.\n\nThe KGB was dissolved when its chief, Colonel-General Vladimir Kryuchkov, used the KGB's resources in aid of the August 1991 coup attempt to overthrow Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. On August 23, 1991 Colonel-General Kryuchkov was arrested, and General Vadim Bakatin was appointed KGB Chairman--and mandated to dissolve the KGB of the Soviet Union. On November 6, 1991, the KGB officially ceased existing, though its successor national state security organisation, the Russian Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti (FSB), is functionally much like the Soviet KGB.\n\nBelarus is the only post-Soviet Union era country where the successor state security organization continues to be known as KGB. Belarus is also the birthplace of Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the founders of the KGB.\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\n\nTasks and organization\n\nIts tasked responsibilities were external espionage, counter-espionage, the liquidation of anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary organisations within the Soviet Union, guarding the national borders, guarding the Communist Party and State leaders, and critical state property. Also, it investigated and prosecuted thieves of State and socialist property and white collar criminals. Unlike Western intelligence agencies, the KGB (theoretically) was uninterested in learning the enemy's intentions--only their capabilities; intentions were political decisions based upon Marxist theory.\n\nIn espionage, the KGB mostly relied on human intelligence (HUMINT), unlike their Western counterparts, who relied more on technology--imagery intelligence (IMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Using ideological attraction, the Soviets successfully recruited many high-level spies. Most notable are the KGB successes in gathering US atomic secrets, and, in the UK, the Cambridge Five, especially Kim Philby of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Ideological recruitment abroad was nearly impossible after the Soviet Union crushed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Instead, KGB was forced to rely upon blackmail and bribery to control most of its defectors. Still, this achieved notable successes, such as CIA mole Aldrich Ames and FBI mole Robert Hanssen, but fewer than in earlier decades.\n\nParalleling developments at MI5 and the CIA, the KGB had, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, commercialized its advanced technologies for business applications. Artificial intelligence software which was formerly used to sort and filter signals intelligence has become available through companies such as Autonomy (an MI5 spin-off) and InfoTame (ex-KGB technologists).\n\nNotable KGB operations\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\nEnlarge\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\n\nDuring the 1945-1991 Cold War, the KGB of the Sov

A long time ago, before people knew what the heart was really used for, it came to be associated with strong emotion. Whenever you feel strong emotion, there's a sensation on the left side of the chest. We now know that sensation is actually caused by chemicals in the brain. Back then, people didn't know that. They just assumed that the heart controlled emotion. Even know we know better now, the old associations still stick with us, as they have become so ingrained in our culture.

Are you sure you have two drives or do you have one drive with two partitions?\nIf you can't put programs or files on the D drive, then it's probably locked (read only). This most likely means it is a backup partition and should not be messed with, anyway.\nThe best solution would be to use the control panel's add/remove programs utility first. Go down the list and uninstall all the programs that you don't use, don't need, or don't want. If you don't recognize a program, don't uninstall it. Next, clean your system. If you're running Windows (most likely), then use the built-in disk cleaner by going to Start - Run - and typing "cleanmgr" (without quotes) and hit ENTER. Select drive C and clean everything from it, possibly including the option that says "compress old files". This takes a while and actually slows your performance slightly, but will be worth it if you need the extra space.\n\nNow that you've uninstalled some crap, you should have room on the drive. Download a small utility called CCleaner from here:\n\nhttp://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/\n\nOn the right, in the green menu, click "Download Latest Version"\n\nOnce it's installed, find it and run it. In the "Cleaner" section, select everything under the Windows and Applications tabs. If you rarely clean your system, it will clear up a significant amount of space that the built-in windows cleaner wouldn't. Under the Issues section, select everything under Registry Integrity and File Integrity. This will remove many invalid entries in your registry and is safe to use without messing anything up - unlike other registry cleaners. If you uninstalled a lot of programs, then there will probably be a lot of left over registry entries here. This doesn't really free up space, but will make your computer more stable and fast - might as well do it while you're in the program.\n\nAlso, in control panel, open Internet Options - General tab - click "Delete Cookies" - Okay then click "Delete Files" - select "Delete all offline content" and click OKAY. This will clear up most of the stuff saved to your computer from the internet, which can free up a significant amount of space if you've surfed the internet alot and never cleaned out these files.\n\nThere are a lot of other utilities that can be used. The other ones I have I either paid for or downloaded illegally, so I won't even bring them up. Hopefully by now you have some room left on the drive.\n\nAs for the automatic update in Itunes, if this still doesn't work, look at the settings. I don't use it, personally.\n\nHope this was helpful and not too boring. Good luck.

Cell phone is short for cellular phone. Cellular refers to the technology used. Also, a mobile phone can almost be considered as just about any phone that can leave a base and does not have a cord.\n\nAs quoted from source: \n\n"Term used currently in the United States and Canada (and in other countries as well during the 1980s) to refer to most mobile phones. It technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network. In developing mobile phone technology, American electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next. After the name "cell" was applied to the zone covered by each antenna, it was a natural choice for them to apply the term "cellular" to both the technology and the phones that ran on it."

He's more interested in saving you than condemning you.\n\nDon't give up on fighting sin, but take it one day at a time. Maybe you beat a particular sin today, but you won't tomorrow. He understands we're not perfect.\n\nIf this particular sin is especially threatening to yourself, your relationships, or to others, then do everything to fight it, but don't be dismayed by occasional loss.\n\nGod Bless.

Well for the reason you just said. I am a S.F giants fan and one of the only main reasons i am SUCH a fan is because of Bonds. I have been a fan of his for 10 years, and i wouldnt know what to do if he left. I dont really mind all the steroid things, but thats besides the point. The point is that theres one aspect that you like about the team, and usually it is the player. I also like the Stadium, which has one of the best atmospheres in all of baseball. I know the Red Sock's fans are crazy and exciting, so the best way to get back in is to go to couple games. Just seeing others so excited will get you motivated as well. It works here in S.F. since a lot of people go to games and get excited over Bonds. But i must say, when Bonds leaves in a year or so, it will never be there same and it will be me asking your same exact question. :(

What is supposed to happen is the senate is to come up with a competing bill. The attempt to use the border enforcement issue to slip in such an extreme amnesty and throw open our borders was so insane and caused such a huge backlash that the whole issue is waaaaay too hot for the senate to touch. Senators know that to not support a strong enforcement only approach is political suicide but they have a strong financial interest in not supporting such a bill (ie they will lose tons of slush money if they come up with a strong bill like 4437). They will kill all attempts to even debate the issue.\n\nLikely, 4437 will become law by default.

Republicans are most often associated with conservative morals and values.\n\nThis means that:\nAbortion is bad\nGay Marriage is wrong\nSocial Security & Medicare should be privatized etc...\n\n\nOne outstanding difference between the mind-set and political ideals of the Republican Party and that of the Democratic Party is that the Republican Party tends to more heavily emphasize the idea that societal health is rooted in personal responsibility and actions. This emphasis is reflected in an inclination to trust markets to optimize outcomes, rather than government mandates.

B is a step up from novice/beginner, BB is the next level up from B (intermediate) and A is advanced. Sometimes, there will be a AA division as well, which is even more advanced than A. \n\nIf a tournament has an OPEN division, that is the highest division offered. If I were you, I would only sign up for OPEN if I were REALLY GOOD & had won some AA tournaments.\n\nIn my experience, in BB, the people are pretty good, but they don't even know where they are going to hit, so it makes it difficult to defend. Sometimes a lot of VERY SLOPPY PLAY.\nIn A, the players are better than B & have more control in their serving & hitting. If you are good defensively, you might be able to "read" where they will hit. These players, however, will be better at placing the ball on the court & can be tricky!\nAA & OPEN players will be VERY GOOD & can almost always put the ball anywhere on the court.

I'm very sorry to hear this, my sympathies go out to you and your family.\n\nMy father-in-law recently passed away from this type of cancer. It runs in my husband's family as his father, grandfather and uncle were also diagnosed.\n\nMy husband's father was given 6 months to live by his doctors but he survived for 2 whole years. He refused any radiation or chemotherapy, as he believed that it would have probably done more harm than good. He did not want to go out that way, he wanted to be as strong as possible for as long as possible.\n\nHe was only 56 when he was diagnosed and 58 when he passed, so since your mother is older she may have different issues to deal with. But my father-in-law was very active until only a few weeks before his passing. The only hints that he was ill was the ever-increasing lump in his abdomen (his tumor), it's accompanying pain, and extreme weight-loss. His pain got slowly worse as time progressed and at the very end he did take pain medications for it as it was quite bad. The medications made him very confused and at the very end he didn't recognize anyone anymore and couldn't use the bathroom by himself.\n\nHe had a very interesting outlook on his sickness. When he was diagnosed initially, he decided to spend his last days doing what he loved most - surfing. He moved to Costa Rica for 8 months and when he didn't die, he decided to come home! The only remedy he took the entire time - aside from the pain meds at the end - was his own urine! Yes, it sounds crazy, but there is apparently some sort of urine-drinking therapy program he learned about and decided to try. It sounded awful, but we couldn't argue with it, as it seemed to be doing something! And he lived a year and a half longer than expected!\n\nMy husband's uncle who was also diagnosed 6 months after his father opted for chemo and radiation. They think they caught his early because the tumor grew on a vital duct and gave him very bad jaundice very early on, so he noticed his symptoms right away. He is recovering now and only experienced pain after his treatments started. Most of his pain came from his surgeries and from his treatment making him so tired! He is in his 40s.\n\nGrandfather was in his mid 80s and passed soon after being diagnosed. Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive and took him quickly. The only solace we took was in that he had lived a full, long, good life. He wasn't in much pain because he was heavily medicated which also made him very confused. He also lost a lot of weight.\n\nAs far as what you should expect ... it's different for everyone. She is older which vastly decreases her chance of survival. No matter what, it will cause her pain because of the tumor pressing on vital organs, and if she is on pain medication she will probably be very "out of it".\n\nThe one thing I want to say is that, if she is going to pass ... if you have anything you need to say to your mother, please tell her! It's morbid but it's such a truth. My husband couldn't find the words to express what he needed to say to his father, even after 2 years of preparation, and it hurt him so deeply. Don't wait until it's too late. Say anything you need to now while she is still aware and capable of communicating coherently.\n\nGod bless you and yours, I wish you the best.

The government of Morocco (north Africa) is indeed quite like that of the United States. It has an Executive, Legislative, and Judicial system just as in the US. The major difference is the head of the executive branch of the US is voted by the people through a process called an electoral college whereas in Morocco it is a monarchy (lineage through birth).\n\nThere are other changes of course (there is no government in the WORLD exactly like the US) and it would be a good idea to read up on it at the following web site\n\nhttp://www.bestmorocco.com\n\nEritrea (east Africa) was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952. It's government is "transitional".\n\nAfter much bloodshed Lesotho (in South Africa) has a government setup with the three branches of government the US employs. There are no elections and the executive branch is a monarchy.\n\nChad (central Africa) is in warfare right now but the three forms of government are in place with elections (over 50% and for 5 years for the President).\n\nNiger (western Africa) I know less about. I know they employ the three branches of government and have a president. How he is elected I do not know.\n\nThe majority difference in these countries is some portion of the countries leaders are APPOINTED (as the President of the US appoints his Cabinet) where leaders in the US are elected and those who are not have to be approved by the Legislative Branch (Congress).
Frank,\n\nI will assume you want to read an XML file avaialble at a URL (which can be file://...) and that you want to extract information from the XML file. I can recommend the dom4j library (http://www.dom4j.org/). With dom4j you can simply write:\n\nSAXReader reader = new SAXReader();\nDocument document = reader.read(url);\n\nYou then have a document object that represents your XML document.

There are two differences between being laid off and being terminated, is how you are treated for the purposes of unemployment insurance. \n\n1. A person who is laid off is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits, while a person who is terminated for a justifiable reason, (i.e., "for cause") is not entitled, because that person brought the loss of employment on him/herself.\n\n2. A person who is laid off in a "cause" jurisdiction, i.e., a State in which an employee cannot be terminated for a reason unrelated to their employment, is entitled to sue for "wrongful termination," if the employee can show that the employer used the layoff as a means of avoiding the cause requirement associated with a termination.\n\nHowever in an "at-will" jurisdiction, an employer needs no reason to terminate an employee, and the only time that an employee can sue for wrongful termination is where there is a strong public interest in ensuring that employees are not terminated for unjust reasons, such as where an employee is terminated for revealing an employer's discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nOther than the above, being laid off and being terminated are exactly the same. There is no implied warranty that you will be rehired for the same job.\n\nSo, in order to answer your question, you would need to know if you are employed in a "cause" jurisdiction. If you are, you may have a case for wrongful termination. Otherwise, you probably don't.\n\nBut, if you're concerned, see an employment lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.

This is a fact of life in a free market economy where a company is traded on an exchange. To prevent the possibility of hostile takeovers would have the effect of undermining the possiblity for many companies to raise capital by going public. \n\nJust because it is called a hostile takeover doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad. It simply means that a majority share of a target publicly-traded company is being acquired by another entity against the wishes of the board, stock holders and even the employees. One doesn't do this with the hope of maintaining morale and good will, as everyone in the target firm resent it and fear losing their jobs. It is usually done by the taking company to gain a competitive advantage of some type, like market share, technology, properties, assets, etc. \n\nHowever, if stock is traded freely on the exchange, it has to be the same for everyone, regardless of intention. How the takeover is conducted is subject to certain regulations, though. A merger that would create an unfair competitive advantage, hostile or not, has to be approved by the SEC.
False, some people can really have an equal attraction to both males and females, I know since both my friend and I are bi-sexual.The reason why many believe that theres no such thing as bi-sexual is because then theres no way to explain it scientifically.

I had them... it DOES hurt. If your teeth are crooked though, it's worth it. Mine weren't though, and my orthodontist ripped off my mom because he made her believe my teeth would EVENTUALLY become crooked. Riiight. When they came off, they looked exactly the same as they did when I had them put on. They really do hurt, though. They'll tear up the insides of your cheeks, and it will hurt so much everytime they tighten the wires. You should try Invisalign, or something.\n\nlol They definitely DON'T look cool either. They make your mouth look all retarded, whether it's open or closed.

Those SATs are going to have to be retaken if he wants any sort of chance of getting in.

I would like to forgive everyone and stop hanging on to the past. Too much hate and regret there. I would like to be content with simply existing as long as it is called "Today."\n\nI need to wake up and realize that just because something isn't how I want it to be doesn't mean I can't enjoy it.
Something keeps the brimstone boiling. Maybe they have an in-sin-erator, HA!
I would like to say yes get back together, but its really not the answer, first you got to forgive yourself these things happen, and to be honest you can't have been in love with in the first place cos you would't have done it so no going back is not the answer, stop worrying about him he's a big boy now.. You need to look to the future with your kids thats the most important thing, bringing him back for the kids sake won't work he'll just throw it at you all the time and it will course fights and thats not good for either you or the kids.. You need to move on, let him insult you as much as he likes, it does't matter what he think's , he's your EX! Go meet someone who you really LOVE... LEAVE THE PAST WERE IT BELONGS IN THE PAST!!!

Mea Culpa is a Latin phrase that translates into English as "my fault", or "my own fault". In order to emphasize the message, the adjective "maxima" may be inserted, resulting in "mea maxima culpa," which would translate as "my most [grievous] fault."\n\nA fifth column is a group of people which clandestinely undermines a larger group to which it is expected to be loyal, such as a nation.\n\nThe term originated with a 1936 radio address by Emilio Mola, a nationalist general during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. As four of his army columns moved on Madrid, the general referred to his militant supporters within the capital as his "fifth column," intent on undermining the Republican government from within (see also Siege of Madrid (1936-39)).\n\nThe term is also used in reference to a population who are assumed to have loyalties to countries other than the one in which they reside, or who support some other nation in war efforts against the country they live in, which make them traitors.\n\nDuring World War II, German minority organizations in Poland and Czechoslovakia formed the Selbstschutz, which actively helped the Third Reich in conquering those nations and engaged in atrocities. The French Underground is a particularly well-known fifth column.\n\nDuring wars, citizens of enemy countries are often held or watched because of concerns that they might be a fifth column. During World War II, enemy aliens and citizens descended from immigrants from enemy countries were interned throughout Allied and Axis countries, from Japan and Japanese-occupied territories such as the Philippines, to India, Canada and Latin America. This was the justification for the Japanese American internment along the West Coast of the United States and the Japanese Canadian internment in British Columbia, Canada. Selected German and other nationals were also held by various US authorities. Irish Catholic residents in the UK have been sometimes viewed in this way by unionists due to "The Troubles" of the late 20th century (see also Guildford Four, Birmingham Six). Recently many Israelis have begun to suggest that Arab citizens of the state constitue a fifth column, citing terrorist-supporting activity by Arab members of parliament (illegal meetings with Hamas terrorists, fundraising, etc.) and not infrequent demonstrations held in Israeli Arab cities in support of Palestinian terror. The recent Israel-Hizbullah war gave Israeli Jews another reason for concern when Israeli Arabs openly supported Hizbullah even as their own cities in northern Israel were being bombed by the Lebanese group.\n\nToday it has a pejorative connotation, whereas partisan can be considered a positive or negative term. Resistance movements are looked upon more favourably than fifth columnists, but it can be argued that there is an overlap between the two.

An allergy is your body's way of protecting you from something that it thinks will do you harm. So clearly your body thinks that your ex is something you should stay away from even if your head and your heart haven't caught up to the rest of you yet.\n\nThat's the snippy response, it's more likely that you're allergic to perfume your ex is wearing or the detergent they are using. But personally, I like the thought that your body is actually rejecting your ex... that's great and smart.
It is very cool of you to continue to be his friend. Please try to be thankful that he was finally able to admit it before you two got married. Some people do know they are gay from childhood and never have any straight relationship. SOme people know it from childhood but have been raised to believe it is sick and wrong, and so work hard to subvert those feelings. That's why some people end up getting married, having kids and coming out of the closet many years down the road. It really isn't a conscious choice to be gay or not to be gay. He can't help preferring men any more than you can. \nIt is best for you to try to distance yourself romantically...

I carried the USP .40cal for about 2 years as a police officer. My department has now switched to the Beretta 92g 9mm. I liked the USP much more. It would fire when dirty, it was easy to clear malfunctions, the grip is solid and rigid, the sights are reliable, and it never misfired unless the ammo was faulty. Great gun. The only thing i did not like about the issued USP was the 12lbs trigger pull. A privately bought gun will not have such a stiff pull. It is a great gun, Really, anything made by HK is great.
Maybe you need to learn how to be a fisher of men read the Gospels Matt mark Luke john they talk about fishing and how they fed a multitude of people with just a couple of fish and Jesus told them were to put there net to catch so many they couldn't even pull their net in and they thought for sure there wasn't any fish there before that. maybe you should visit some other \nchurch i think church is awesome. hope you have fun fishing.

logcfu refers to the number of colony forming units of a bacteria, to work out the g/ml you need to know the weight of the bacteria. As its the g/ml I guess you're looking at wet weight. The average weight of a bacteria is 9.5E-13 g [1]. Then you have to consider the size of the colony, it is normally assumed (for simplicity) that the bacteria have been diluted, so that they could be counted, to the extent that 1 bacteria = 1 cfu. Essentially this means that cfu*9.5E-13 = g/ml\n\nHope this helps

You have two options. \n\nYou can cut calories and perform crunches like crazy, try one of the hot new incredible infomercial ab devices and buy the lastest new and improved “fat burner”. \n\nAlso there is another option but it is not too popular. Eat right, Understand functions of the abdominal muscles, work the body as a whole, and allow for ongoing fat release. \n\nOf all of two options, there is only one that "works," all of the time. Unfortunately, it “appears” to be the most complicated. \n\nHere is the Real Ab-Solution:\n\nBefore we go any further, I would like to point out that slimming down your abdominal parts REALLY means reducing you body fat percentage in those areas. Therefore, the goal is to reduce your body fat percentage. \n\nNow that we understand what we are seeking, let us zero in on the solution.\n\nStep 1: Eat right to release the fat from the fat cells\n\n"Eat right" sounds so simplistic, but the idea is maximize natural unprocessed foods and minimize processed or junk foods (Please do not go on a depravation diet, it will make things worse). However, you also need to eat in a way that supports Fat loss.\n\nThe real trick lies in stabilizing blood sugar, which allows fat to be released from your fat cells. You would do that by eating meals free from simple sugars and refined carbs, low in processed saturated fat, and balanced with protein, complex carbs, fiber, and essential fatty acids. \n\nStep 2: Move your body to burn the fat in the muscle cells.\n\nOnce the fat is release from the cells, they need to be burned in your muscle cells. Releasing the body fat is not enough; you need to support your nutrition with a more active lifestyle. If you are not active, the released fat just goes back to the fat cells and they are not burned. Burning that fat make your “six packs” visible. \n\nYou not only need to work on your abs or core muscles but you also need to work you the body as a whole (focus on the major muscles like your legs and back).\n\nThen you need to optimize circulation with moderate aerobic exercise (do not go crazy), and fat release should be consistent and ongoing, and a little at a time, those abs will shine through.\n\nDO NOT continue doing something just because "THEY" say it's the way things should be done. Allow yourself to choose the solution that will work for you, regardless of what it may be. The only way for you to know who is right is to measure your progress and ACTUALLY track your results.\n\nCHANGE IS HARD, but it's also worth it. Not getting results makes change EXTREMELY HARD.\n\nGet support from friends, family or a coach. Losing weight is not as hard at it seems once you know what to do. Stop now and sign up to my Forbidden Weight loss Secrets blog at http://www.charlesblain.com because you will receive weight loss secrets that you will not get anywhere else.

Time could be defined as a dimension. We are always subconsciously aware of this time. We use it to define how long things would take. For example we can say that an x program will last for about an hour. So my definition of time would be that it is used to define how long a specific thing or event would take or took. And as long as you are on the earth and not moving really fast, you can say that it is constant meaning the same every where. I don't mean to say that 1 p.m. here is 1 p.m. everywhere. But I mean that an hour here is hour everywhere on earth.

HD = hard drive.\n\nIt is a storage system for your computer. It is located inside the motherboard of your computer. It is the "brain" of your system and it stores a lot of data and information. It is the memory of your computer that you can store large amount of data and it will keep it in there until you want access to them. It is internal, but it can also be external. Your local harddrive is normally your local memory thats internal and it might have stored your O.S (for example, Windows XP, Windows 98, Windows NT) and other programs that you have stored into it. It is generally referenced as your C: drive.\n\nAlso, the hard drive goes by different memories. The bigger the memory, the more you can store things in your computer like programs and games. They go by megs or gigs. One mp3 song that you download is about 4-5 megs. Nowadays, computers come with gigs of memory. Every 1 gigabyte of memory is equal to 1024 megabytes.\n\nIf you have any more questions, just contact me =)

Jehovah's Witnesses abhor abuse and domestic violence. Witnesses fully understand that their role as a religion is in providing comfort to the victim and her family, warning to potential victims, extolling Christian peaceableness and righteousness, and eventually perhaps in couseling a repentant sinner.\n\nGovernment workers such as police and prosecutors are generally empowered to pursue criminal matters. Jehovah's Witnesses always work in obedience to secular law and deference to the personal decisions of victims (and their families, where practical). Jehovah's Witness ministers do not investigate criminal matters, leaving such matters to law enforcement authorities.\n\nAn unrepentant baptized Jehovah's Witness who is found guilty of a serious secular crime is likely to be disfellowshipped (or "excommunicated", although Witnesses do not use this latter term). However, a sin against God's supreme authority is clearly a different matter from a sin against secular superior authorities. The standards for criminal conviction and forced religious disassociation will never be identical.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/w/1997/1/1/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/g/1985/1/22/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/w/1995/11/1a/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/g/1996/5/22/article_02.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/717263.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/713173.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/716353.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/region/global/english/backgrounders/e_molestation.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/region/americas/usa/english/releases/educational/usa_e990402a.htm
Click on your Profile or "my q and a" and you can either go through your answers to see the resolved ones and click on it to see if you were picked as the best answer or you can see on the right hand side were it says "my recent activity" but that only shows you about 5 or 6 recent ones so, the best thing is go through your answers and check it that way.

Because if they lie to you once, chances are they'll lie to you again. Actually alot of people are just kidding around sometimes, so eventually they regain the other persons trust..It just takes a while for some people, or if it was a serious lie then it's hard to forgive them unless you see that they really regret what happened..

Sit down at a table with two pieces of paper. On one paper write all the reasons you act the way you do. "the attitude" you mentioned. \nOn the other paper, write down the reasons you think you should'nt act the way you do.\nWhen you are finished, look at the reasons you have this "attitude" Compare it to the reasons you should not. \nThen consider if you want to change for this person. If so, throw the paper away that has the reasons you act the way you do. Take the paper that says the reasons you should not and use them as a guide to change for this person. \nIf you do not want to change for this person, throw away both papers and let him divorce you... Its cheaper.

Many politicians today are career politicians. Their motivation and the decisions that they make owes more to whether it will serve them well personally, rather than what might be in the best interests of the country. This current Government has forgotten that it is there to serve us, and not to set up a left wing totalitarian regime, which seems aimed more at destroying British culture with its obsession with PC, minorities, immigration, and the eventual handing over of sovereignty to the EU. We have never had a government so absolutely determined to destroy the traditional English way of life. Unfortunately, the process has been going on for some time, aided and abetted by indoctrination from left leaning teachers/lecturers, and not forgetting the biased TV media.

As far as land and property goes, in the "old days" you simply staked out a claim. In present time, you actually have to purchase the land you live on and hold a title to that land. Without a title of ownership, anyone can take it from you. It's like finders keepers. If I take something from you and you cannot prove that it was yours with documentation or present some sort of proof in court that you possessed it or I stole it, it's mine and there is nothing you can do about it. Drop $100 bill on the street and see if you can get it back from the person who picks it up.\n\nAs far as rights and the constitution. You do not have to claim the rights of the country you were born in. If you are born in the United States you recieve a birth certificate and the government documents your existance with a Social Security number. If you have these thing, you automatically recieve the rights granted to you under the constition.

Terry Sawchuk\n Roy is probably the best goalie of this era (Brodeur is right there with him). Sawchuk performed without a mask in the Original 6 (when every player was extremely talented) and set the bar for todays goalies to reach. While todays goalies have great numbers we need to remember that they play against teams that lack good scoring, have better defenders in front of them, better defensive systems and far bigger and better equipment.\n Also Sawchuk had to do it when traveling by train was the way to go, there usually wasnt a backup goalie and no trainers to provide the comforts todays goalies have. Not knocking todays goalies because we have the good fortune of watching great goaltending today, I just think under the circumstances and the pure numbers that Sawchuk is the best goalie of all time!

Jack wakes up with a huge hangover after attending his company's Christmas party. Jack is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. \n\nAs bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong. Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! \n\nJack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house. \n\nHe takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: \n"Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian" \n\nHe stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, Steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. \n\nJack asks, "Son ... what happened last night?" \n"Well, you came home after 3 A. M., drunk and out of your mind. You Fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, And got that black eye when you ran into the door." \nConfused he asked his son, "So, why is everything in such perfect Order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??" \n\nHis son replies, "Oh THAT!... Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when She tried to take your pants off, you screamed, "Leave me alone, lady, I'm married!" \n\nBroken Coffee Table $39.99 Hot Breakfast $4.20 Two Aspirins $.38 \n\nSaying The right thing, at the right time.

You might find later that it's worse than you thought. If you're a victim of, or a witness to a traffic collision, here are the steps to take:\n\n * Call the police. If needed, get medical help immediately.\n * Get the following information from every vehicle: driver name, address, phone number, driver's license number, license plate number, make of car, insurance company name and policy number.\n * Get the names and phone numbers of witnesses.\n * Get the police report number from police on the scene.\n * Write down how the crash happened while it's fresh in your memory.\n * Keep (or photograph) any damaged clothes or equipment. Also, if you're a victim:\n * Don't get mad at the scene. Keep a level head so you can ask questions and take notes.\n * If you're injured, don't move unless you're sure you won't injure yourself more

The manager defines the tactics of the team, decides which players to play in every game, and decides which player the team should buy (Generally).

They are assigned to train the players on their physical ability and skills.\nThe manager doesn't deal with business matter such as merchandising, ticket price, etc. That is the job of the board of director or General Manager.

Umpires can and will reverse a call if they realize they made a mistake, several times over the past and present seasons I have seen the umpires gather together to discuss the call and sometimes they will change it and make the right call if it's agreed by the group that it needs changed. It is very hard to change a call on a bang, bang play. The umps have to make their best judgment call and leave it at that.

Never mention the chance to earn a big salary, they will think this is all you are after - guaranteed.\n\n Other questions may be along the lines of: give an example of a situation where you solved a problem, what was the outcome, what would you do differently next time. Give an example of when you have come up with an innovative solution. Give an example of when you have worked as part of a team, what was your role. Give an example of when you have led a team. What are ur strengths/weaknesses. Give an example of when you have planned something from scratch through to completion, again, how was it, what would you change. Give an example of when you have communicated effectively.

Here's the issue: The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite. We can define space "\n\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \n\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \n\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \n\nA period or interval of time. \nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers."\n\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties. Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty. Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable. If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond "No". This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled. You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc. Not so with infinity. Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing. The base problem with my definition is that "things" and "existence" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception. Infinity must be something other than that. Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity? Try this one, "Infinity is all unthings non-existing". that's the closest I can get. Give it a shot. But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite.

The Qur'an (also Quran, Koran, Alcoran;) is the Islamic holy book of Allah (Arabic for God).

The Qur'an retells stories of many of the people and events of the Jewish and Christian Bibles, although it differs in many details.

Low decay rates persist even years after the trials have been completed.

Reptiles do not use body fat to generate heat, but they _do_ store energy as fat and use it when food supply is low, or, in the case of females, to provide nutritive substances for their eggs during the breeding season. Geckoes, for instance, accumulate fat on the basal portion of their tails. Thus the "fat" tail of a gecko indicates a well-fed individual.

You might also consider volunteering for a crisis center or shelter - you may even be able to get a job there in some aspect of therapy, support, or counseling. You can't work as a psychologist with just an undergraduate degree, but I expect you know that. \n\nMany large companies are interested in individuals with psychology degrees as they are realizing that the more technical degrees don't necessarily always prepare individuals well for the real life of work, so check out job postings in areas you might like to live. You never know what may turn up.\n\nWhat I always advised my children was if they saw a job advertised which they were interested in and thought they could do, apply, even if they didn't have the exact qualifications. If you can present yourself well, and are a quick learner, interviewers pick up on that - they are always looking for people with potential. \n\nBest of luck with your job search.
Chhota Rajan and his wife are already in Indian jail caught by the Mumbai police, where as Dawood Ibrahim is taking asylum in Pakistan. He is in Karachi and Indian Police have no jurisdiction beyond India. What we see in Indian movies is not even 10% reality. if the cinema heroes try to be 'Don' in real life they will land up in jail the next moment. Police in India is not as bad as they are projected through movies. They have solved very tough cases whenever they have wanted. It is the politicians who create problems for handling cases in accordance with law. Otherwise both the law and the police in India are adequate and efficient.

It also reminds me of another Vietnam. Back then America didnt realise a huge part of the population supported the communist regime. Now America dosent realise that many people, for some reason, liked hussain. Trying to force democracy on them to be honest is quite insulting in a way because their is a conspiracy that bush didnt even win your own election. But here America and Britain our forcing our ways on people who are totally opposed. How can you fight against a people who condone suicide bombing?? Its impossible. My only hope is that the troops who eventually return defeated are not treated in the same way the returning soldiers were after Vietnam.

Yes, there are many books you can get at the library on this subject. It is your subconsciuos telling you what you need to know. Don't try to interpret them on your own. Get a good book to tell you what they mean.
Are you kidding me? A book could be written on the subject. You will find no complete answers here.
When I asked my dad that he told me there is no God, and told me that he has always wondered why man is so vain to presume that there is a God who had made us in his image? Why are we all different shapes and colour and sizes? He said the only thing about the bible that had any credence was the creation myth, if the Earth was truly made in 6 days it would explain why there were so many problems in the world, as God clearly didn't put any thought or planning into it.
Science makes more sense.If people are hearing god speak to them, they need to have their head checked.I beleieve in facts and not something you cannot see.

Wayne Rooney has no chance of figuring in England's group matches at the World Cup but could be ready for the knockout stages, according to sports injury expert Roger Roberton.\n\nRooney broke the fourth metatarsal in his right foot during Manchester United's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea on Saturday, sparking fears he could miss the entire tournament which begins in 40 days.\n\n"Wayne is young and has a good team around him. The main thing is he mustn't do any hard-impact exercise," Roberton told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.\n\n"It's better for him to swim. Being young it can take between four and six weeks for this injury to repair properly.\n\n"He must build up gradually the amount of exercise he does and have rest days between sessions. When running 40 or 50% of the body's weight is put on the metatarsal's head.\n\n"He should rest and not do much exercise and should be back to normal in four to six weeks.\n\n"I would doubt very much if he could make the first game, or even the second, of the group stages. I would say he can be back in seven weeks. I would build up between four and five weeks."\n\nSPORTINGLIFE>COM

Sometimes it like using a metaphor - it just makes the English language more bloody colourful! Sometimes, people swear because they are total morons and don't understand the swear words they are using - and it's the only way they can express their emotions. They are too stupid to have opinions, they have just emotions - usually anger and they express that anger with a tirade of obscenities. I don't mind a little colour added to the language - the odd mild swear word can help express the strength of feeling. those morons, who upset people with obscenities, they're just arseholes that should be taken out and flogged to an inch of their lives....

definitely. it's actually the "in" thing these days. I have seen people carrying these huge suitcases around to starbucks and plopping them down on the table, setting up their huge computer and monitor, plugging everything in, even getting their laser printer ready. the problem is that there is no place to put your coffee. In the car you might have a problem with getting electricity. but I suggest you invest in a 100 mile long electrical cord to solve that problem. in the plane you can tap into their main electrical supply, which will divert all the power from the engine into your computer. you will also have to buy an extra ticket for your desktop computer to sit in the seat next to you, so it might actually be cheaper to buy a laptop.

It depends upon where you are located.\n\nIf the house is under foreclosure it is a legal proceeding and if the court has not issued an order assigning the rents to the court or to the mortgage holder then it would be payable to the landlord.\n\nI would stay in the house as long as possible without paying rent to anyone. Once you have recouped your costs from the free rent then either move or contact the mortgage company. Maybe there is an opportunity to become a homeowner.\n\nIf either side provides a court order saying they are entitle to receive the rent then advise the party that you have prepaid X$ to the owner and her Realtor. And will vacate one it is either repaid or been compensated by free rent.\n\nThe mortgage holder will like the idea of someone occupying the house until they are ready to sell it. It is free protection for their property.

A quadratic function can have 0,1,or 2 x-intercepts. Put a negative parabola (opens downward) over the Cartesian plane and move it around. You'll see that 0 intercepts occur if the parabola is completely in the negative y part of the plane, 1 intercept occurs only in the special case where the vertex of the parabola is also a (double) root of the parabola, and two roots occur if any part of the parabola is positive.\nSo in other words, find out where your vertex is! For parabola y(x)=ax^2+bx+c, the vertex is at the point x=-b/(2a). Note that you can also complete the square to get the same information. A third route is to use the quadratic formula to see how many real roots the function has, which is how many times it touches the x-axis. Use whichever method seems easiest to you at the time.

Put simply, efficiency equals the power you receive divided by the power you put in. You'll need these 4 basic equations.\nPower = work / time\nWork = Force * distance\nForce = Mass * acceleration\nEfficiency = Output/Input (in %)\n\nThe motor is rated at 100w, so that is the power you put in.\nTo lift 50kg, you need to overcome gravity. In this case, Mass = 50kg, gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s.\nFrom here you can calculate the force required. Then you can calculate the work done, and then the power. This is the power you receive. From here, you can calculate the efficiency.\n\nTry to work it out on your own. You'll learn more.

When a space probe passes around a planet the orbital energy of the spacecraft relative to the planet will remain constant and so from the point of view of the planet the spacecraft will not be moving any faster on the way out as it was on the way in.\n\nBut the planet orbits the sun and when one looks at the trajectory from a sun centered point of view then the momentum of the spacecraft is greater on the way out then it is on the way in.\n\nFor conservation of momentum to hold the planet must lose the same amount of momentum as the spacecraft gained. Of course since planets are typically many orders of magnitude heavier than space probes the change in the orbit of the planet is so small that we can't detect it.

Turquoise this is the color,,, but in eyes it is different:\nBlue-Green eyes\n \nBlue-green eyes, here with a yellow ring around the pupil, may appear to change colorA variant of blue eyes, blue-green eyes are quite rare and usually consist of an iris with a predominantly blue color, usually darker blue, with green streaks or stippling caused by a yellow- or copper-colored overlay. Yellow-, amber-, or copper-colored rings are often present around the pupil.\n\nThe exact color is often perceived to vary according to its surroundings. Wearing lighter blue colors or getting tanned tends to emphasize the blue components. Wearing bright red, green, and shades of yellow or brown can emphasize green components, or even give the impression of grey\n A hazel eye is not the case:Hazel is usually used to describe eyes that contain elements of both green eyes and brown eyes, sometimes transitioning from green at the edges to brown around the pupil. This should not be confused with irises that display a brown, yellow, or copper-colored ring around the pupil, as in the grey iris shown below.\n\nSo i think ur eyes color is BLUE GREEN

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.

What is the brand name for adderall? Add Details please. \n\nEdit: I looked up adderall by typing it into my yahoo search bar. It has a site that you can look up drug interactions and side effects.\n\nI didn't find anything in regard to nicotine or the patch. \n\nHowever it is always best to consult a pharmacist,ER, or your physician rather than rely on the info from the internet.\n\nThis medication id highly habit forming and has some very serious side effects associated with it. From reading the info provided here,I would strongly recommend not using the patch or nicotine. This is my opinion based on the information I read about this med though. Knowing what it is used for and the consequences of the med itself,I would suggest that you not use the patch or nicotine;even if it is only until you're able to reach your physician.\n\n~Z~

I went through exactly the same thing. I was in England, he was in Ireland. It's not a huge distance to make a relationship work, and the flights are dirt cheap. Just one piece of advice for you; if one of you decides to make the move permanently across the water, make sure you both have your own lives and friends. I split with the man I moved for and it was very lonely being on my own away from home. But I built up my own live, and have now lived in Ireland for 8 years, and the guy is long gone, but I would never go home now!

As an IBO, my first responsibility is to account for all monies that are received and all monies that are expenses. For instance, I am involved in a number of business (as an IBO) and I have a separate bank account for income and expenses for them (ie: one bank account, several streams of income and expenses, but the IRS would like to see personal monies and business monies separated. I was lucky in that one bank in my area gave me $300 just for opening a business account. Of course, I ahd to have an EIN, rather than a SSAN, but that can be done with the IRS on line and takes just a few minutes of your time. Just be sure to keep accurate records of income and expenses for your schedule C at tax time. If you use your car during the operation of the business, go to your local office supply store and get a little mileage booklet for a couple of bucks (tax deductable) for recording your mileage.\ngood luck in your endeavor.\nbob

if you buy items for a business, you can claim they are a "business expense" and deduct them from your gross income when you pay your taxes. so, you only pay taxes on a smaller amount of income. for personal expenses, you can write off the interest on your mortgage, and a bunch of other thigns that I don't know about since i am not an accountant... but even things like moving expenses can apparently be written off your annual gross income... so then you only pay taxes on a small portion of this.

If you have no money, and they love you, then it's obvious that's better... Disaster can easily take each, your love, or your money away, the only difference is money can be garnered again, but will you ever have opportunity to love that person in this world if they die first?\n\nEverything must be valued, but only in its proper degree, since loving something like money over people is sure to leave you less well off than if you love and care for people so much, that with the friends you gain from it, they'll always be glad to help you out too.\n\nMoney can't really give back like that, since you work to acquire it, but it's other people that make the product or do the service you want to buy with it, so it's always people's value that's traded, never money in itself. \n\nThis can be done without money in just working for them, and they'll help out, so the benefits of both love and money are evident with love, but money hides the value of love from you. Even if someone loves you with your focus on money how will you observe truly what you're not focused on? So with a focus on money true love will always pass you by.\n\nMoney itself is worthless, except it's an agreeable trade between you and what you do value, which is always what others provide for that money, and since we all need that, with or without monetary existence, we love people, and never money - no matter how it may appear superfiscally. ;)

No I have not, but I plan to when it arrives, in my area. \n\nI Strongly doubt everyone will see it though. Some people are guided by something other than scientific evidence. For centuries the science community has bumped heads with the establishment. Peoples set beliefs can prove to be very difficult to change. Educating the young is most probably the best way to get the job done. \n\nStill, Others have such a big stake in the Middle East and its oil, that "inconvenient truth" is a great understatement .\n\nGood luck getting the word out. \n\nMaybe after the movies initial release, it will be available for students to see in their schools; Or maybe it will become available to Public Television viewers.

Tell yourself you are going to go, but only for 10 minutes. Once you are there, the same inertia that kept you from going will now be working to keep you from leaving early. Also, unless you are training for a marathon or something, there is no need to go everyday. Space it out and give your muscles a chance to rest and recover.
Most health care providers adhere to the best preventive - washing hands. They do so between patients, procedures, you name it. It will work for you. Beyond that, don't brush off symptoms thinking they will pass in time. Have it checked. Keep in mind, if your in your first year in a health care field, illnesses can be rampant until your immune system builds up. That is a problems with kids today. Many are not allowed to get dirty leaving nothing for their immune system to fight. Same with animals. Kids that are around cats and dogs from an early age will build up imunitites and not become allergic. Hope this helps.

The Sun's core can reach 10 to 22.5 million°F. The surface temperature is approximately 9,900°F (5,500°C). The outer atmosphere of the Sun (which we can see during a solar eclipse) gets extremely hot again, up to 1.5 to 2 million degrees. At the center of big sunspots the temperature can be as low as 7300 °F (4300 K, 4000 °C). The temperature of the Sun is determined by measuring how much energy (both heat and light) it emits.\n\n\n\nlol davidroberts...hadn't heard that joke in a long time

it would be far worse to find out u were cheated on, than your spouse telling u and wanting to reconcile. if my spouse had wanted to go to therapy, or shown me i had a chance i would have given it my all, and tried my best to forgive. but i had no decision in the matter, it was decided by him and the women he had been seeing for over a year. working it out is far better than a divorce, because i believe there is nothing broken that can't be repaired with god's help. divorce is painful, especially when it involves another person. and had it not been for the presence of this other person in my marriage, i do believe he would have come home. if he is truly sincere, and knows he has caused u pain, and takes responsibility than it is always best to make a go of it, and pray for a happy ending.being a sucess is not as important as taking that first step and trying. a hurt heart takes time to heal, one can't go back into being trustful right away. if they want to work it out that means they are remorseful and know a wrong was done, means they have a concience and they aren't just thinking of themselves. does depend on how many times one has had this happen, and how many times you have been injured by someone elses wrong choices, but if it only happened once, than there is hope. the injured spouse must be able to feel safe, and that it is ok to trust again, it can be achieved in time if the cheater is willing to be completely honest, and if no funny business occurs again.

It will be warmer due to absorption of long-wave infrared by greenhouse gases.\n\nYour question could just as easily be worded as "How does the greenhouse effect work?" To see an excellent explanation and illustrations of how greenhouse gases absorb infrared energy go to:\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html\n\nThe principle operates the same here on Earth as it does on Venus, it is just that Venus has some other effects that have exacerbated the atmospheric content of CO2, along with its much higher atmospheric pressures. Most of the Russian Venera probes to Venus lasted about an hour on the surface, at a temperature of about 850 F. and pressures equal to about 3000 ft below the sea (90 times earth's atmosphere).

By the way he has fought up until now NO!, many people see him as being one of the best all time greats, putting him up with Tommy Hearns, Marvelous Hagler, Roberto Duran, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Salvador Sanchez, Julio Cesar Chavez,,,,lets not forget those guys are up there because they have fought wars not "cllinics" in the ring and not dodging any opponets...how does Mayweather expect anyone to give him credit when he dodges great fighters and picks fighters he knows he can beat to show his skills and improve his "perfect" record (he lost that first fight against Castillo). \n\nTo be one of the best you need to fight wars in the ring to be remembered. People still talk about Hearns vs. Hagler, Hearns vs. Leonard, Duran vs. Leonard, Ali vs. Frazier, Sanchez vs. Gomez, Chavez vs. Taylor, Morales vs. Barrera...tell me Mayweather vs. ?\n\nThe best fighters are remember by their battles in the ring not by putting up "clinics".

You said it.. THe title is "Boom" a song by POD, but I've heard that on the longest yard Nelly sings it. I've heard the song from the video game, but you may tried the one by POD. It's really good.

Every artist can have different songs loaded to play when you go onto their Myspace page. If you find the song you like (like "Miss Murder" on http://myspace.com/afi), then click on the "add" option underneath the song title on the player. It will ask you if you are sure you want to change your song to [whatever] and just click yes. Now every time your profile is looked at on Myspace, that song will play.\n\nWhen an artist takes a song off of their player to add a new one (say, when AFI took Silver and Cold off to add Miss Murder), all the people who had the song on their site now have the box that says "Song deleted by the artist". Has nothing to do with legality. Hope this helps.
I like bass fishing in cold water. Here in middle Georgia lakes never freeze more than some skim ice, and that is unusual. Usually the coldest water I fish is around 45 degrees, and most winters it will range from there to about 52. These tactics have worked for me in that range of water temps over the years. \n\n• Fish slowly. Bass slow down as the water cools. They are less likely to hit a fast moving bait, so slow your presentation down and give them time to eat your bait.\n\n• Fish steeper banks. In-Fisherman Magazine recommends fishing banks that have at least a 30 percent drop and 45 is better. Bass like to move vertically in a short distance during the winter so bluff banks are good.\n\n• Chose a bait you can keep in one place on the bottom. A jig and pig is a classic bait for cold water. Crawl it slowly along and make it stop and twitch when you bump cover. A jigging spoon moved up and down in one place works well. Slow moving crankbaits and spinnerbaits slow rolled, or crawled, on the bottom are also good.\n\n• Fish Deeper. Bass tend to hold deep in the winter, so look for the ends of long points, steep bluff banks and creek channels. They hold there until there are several warm days, then they move up into more shallow water.\n\n• Be patient. Don't expect a lot of bites, but the ones you get may be big bass. Take your time and wait on that one big bite.\n\n• Dress for the weather. You can't catch bass if you are miserable or if you can't stay out there. Get warm clothes and layer so you can adjust. Be sure you have something with you that will turn rain and stop the wind, too.\n\nI caught my biggest bass ever, a 9 pound, 7 ounce beauty, the second weekend in February a few years ago. She hit a slow moving crankbait on a steep rocky point. It was the only bite I got that day. I caught my first 8 pound bass in a January tournament on a slowly moved crankbait. I caught my second 8 pounder on a big spinnerbait crawled across the bottom, in a January tournament. Both of them were also the only bites I got those days.\n\nGive winter bass fishing a try.

t the tens digit\nu the units digit\n\n 6(t+u)=10t+u\n5u=4t\n5/4u = t Now since t an u must be whole number digits,\nu must be a multiple 4, like 4 or 8.\nIf u=4 then t=5/4(4)=5 and the number would be 54.\nLet's check\n 6(5+4)=6(9)=54 OK\n\nLet's try u=8\n(5/4)(8)= 10 which is supposed to be t but 10 is not a digit\n\n\nSo 54 is the only answer

Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two "healthy meals" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to.

It means through a chain of no more than 6 people you can connect yourself to any person in the world. It may not be universally true, and it requires certain channels of communications (eg. a famous person you know is a better link than Joe Blow).\n\nFor example, I met my member of parliament in Canada. He works with the Canadian Prime minister. The PM knows the US president. Shrub has (probably) met your senator. And you could meet your senator.

One way would be to generate a random number between 1 and 20.\nIf the number is 1 generate a second random number in the range 1-4. If the first number is in the range 2 to 4, generate a second number in the range 5-14. Otherwise generate the second number in the range 15-20.\n\nAnother way would be to generate a number in the range 0-399.\nIf the number is less than 20 divide it by 5, round down, add 1.\nIf it is in the range 20-79, subtract 20, divide by 6 and round down, add 5.\nIf it is in the range 80-399, subtract 80, divide by 10, round down, then add 15.
For Reagent Grade (ACS Specifications) Nitric Acid, HNO3, Conc., 69 to 71%, approx. sp gr 1.42, approx. 16 N, you can usually assume 70 % HNO3.\n\nFor 1.00 L of 30% HNO3 you would need:\n\n30/70 * 1000 mL/L = 428.5 mL of acid diluted to 1.00 L with pure water.\n\nAlway add the acid to some of the water in a volumetric flask, then add the rest of the water to the full line.

Well, if the energy is potential energy (in other words, the water is on top of a hill), then you can let the water flow down the hill (converted to kinetic energy) and in so doing, pass it through a turbine to create electricity. This is often done with the use of dams. The water is held back in a lake. As the water is realesed through the damn, it turns the turbines.\n\nCommonly referred to as hydroelectric power.\n\nSide note: If you live near Harper's Ferry, WV they have an incredible display of the power of water. Back before the days of electricity, they hooked a watermill up to a interconected system of pullies and leather straps. Through these, they powered an asortment of different machines such as drills and saws. Basically, a shop full of power tools with no electricity.

(m)\n\nThe B Vitamins\nThere's more than one B vitamin. Here's the list: B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid, biotin, and pantothenic acid. Whew - that's quite a group! \n\nThe B vitamins are important in metabolic (say: meh-tuh-bah-lik) activity - this means that they help make energy and set it free when your body needs it. So the next time you're running to third base, thank those B vitamins. This group of vitamins is also involved in making red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. Every part of your body needs oxygen to work properly, so these B vitamins have a big job. \n\nWhich foods are rich in vitamin B?\n\nwhole grains, such as wheat and oats \nfish and seafood \npoultry and meats \neggs \ndairy products, like milk and yogurt \nleafy green vegetables \nbeans and peas \ncitrus fruits, such as oranges

Actually, Hamdi wasn't released. He was forcibly deported.\n\nAnd the Bush administration ignored the Hamdi ruling in the matter of Jose Padilla, who was held without charges for years until being charged with unrelated crimes a few months ago.\n\nThe Real ID Act in July 2005 changed the Habeas procedure in certain cases, including most immigration deportation cases, to eliminate Habeas review at the Federal District Court level, though Circuit Court of Appeals review is still available.\n\nFinally in December 2005, the Senate passed a bill [S. 1042] removing the rights of 'enemy combatants' to challenge their status in any federal courts, thus eliminating Habeas review. This is the infamous Graham amendment, and was publicly supported by the White House. \n\nIt was later merged into the appropriations bill, along with Senator McCain's Anti-Torture provisions, which this bill largely bypasses. Bush signed the bill into law, along with the infamous signing statement where he claims presidential authority to ignore the laws prohibiting torture and fair treatment or prisoners whenever he sees fit.

If you insist, I will answer. I will give now a short answer , but later on I want to give a real long answer. I have final exams; therefore, I have hurry. Remind me , again!\nAnyway, first of all I wonna know the exact part of Quran from which this muslim has quoted these words. I didn't memorized the whole book . And I want to read this part , again because I want to read the whole paragraph. \nHere is my answer. You are right. God is omniscient and not only omniscient. Time has no meaning for him. He is not time dependent. There is no before or after for him. So, we cant talk about "He made a mistake (past) but will(future) not do again." . Quran speaks clearly about the perfection of Quran and its invulnurability. You know my answer about the bible's corruption . So, there is no god's mistake , ther is only choice, order and creation of the god, which is mistakeless. What happened to bible was not a mistake, but may be a sign of it completed its duty and an other one will come. The deaths of the prophets was the same thing, their duty was over. They completed it. So, there is no mistake about it. This person has given to you a wrong answer or couldn't explain his thought clearly and made a mistake. \nBesides that! These two sentences from Quran (but I want to see the whole paragraph, I hope they are really quotes.) means that: \nSecond one (you will never do it) is pretty clear. \nFirst one (you wouldn't be able to do it) is telling about the mistake of people. It is a sentece like : If you are really true believers, you wouldn't be able to do it" because true believers respect the God and this respect contains also a fear! Fear of doing such a great mistakes which will corrupt the book of god. People who corrupted the bible and old tastament will pay for it! They were just liers , who seemed some times as good people or real priests or what ever. This is underlined with these words of Quran. I am not adding to these group every one. There were great christian saints even after corruption. God bless them! But esspecially in the times of old testament , man of religion changed it a lot for their own good and won more power over people! I think that is enough for now! Funny thing is this sentence doesn't mean your comment. Your answer is manipulating the meaning. OK, may be you really understand it that way and that's why you asked it. I hope it was a misunderstanding or questioning not a manipulation. \nBye for now!\n\nWhen you can find me the correct numbers of the quote, I will read the whole paragraph. I also will try to find it. It is my responsibility and I will keep it!

I believe you are asking about the legal concept of Eminent Domain: \n\nEminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to "appropriation" under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term "condemnation" is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value).

I am 28 and have osteoarthritis in my hip, ankle and back. It is becoming more common in younger ppl. Mine is from injuries and being hard on my body(I was pregnant 8 times in 10 years..delivered 7 kids) There are things you can do to ease the pain. Light stretches like pilates and beginner yoga are good. Also not carrying extra weight around(still working on that one) eases pain on your bones and joints. Take it easy when you feel the pain. Drinking lots of water is sposed to help too. GOODLUCK!!

Your best bet I think is to go for private grants. You may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants. It's a subscription based website and contains listings of foundations who might be willing to support something like your project. \n\nYou can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your objectives.\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs

You already have the title of the poem and the author. However, I thought I would find out something about the poem\n\nFirstly, here are the words:\n \nThe boy stood on the burning deck\n Whence all but he had fled;\nThe flame that lit the battle's wreck\n Shone round him o'er the dead. \n\nYet beautiful and bright he stood,\n As born to rule the storm;\nA creature of heroic blood,\n A proud, though child-like form. \n\nThe flames rolled on–he would not go\n Without his Father's word;\nThat father, faint in death below,\n His voice no longer heard. \n\nHe called aloud–'say, Father, say\n If yet my task is done?'\nHe knew not that the chieftain lay\n Unconscious of his son. \n\n'Speak, father!' once again he cried,\n 'If I may yet be gone!'\nAnd but the booming shots replied,\n And fast the flames rolled on. \n\nUpon his brow he felt their breath,\n And in his waving hair,\nAnd looked from that lone post of death\n In still yet brave despair. \n\nAnd shouted but once more aloud,\n 'My father! must I stay?'\nWhile o'er him fast, through sail and shroud,\n The wreathing fires made way. \n\nThey wrapt the ship in splendour wild,\n They caught the flag on high,\nAnd streamed above the gallant child,\n Like banners in the sky. \n\nThere came a burst of thunder sound–\n The boy–oh! where was he?\nAsk of the winds that far around\n With fragments strewed the sea!– \n\nWith mast, and helm, and pennon fair,\n That well had borne their part–\nBut the noblest thing which perished there\n Was that young faithful heart.\n\n********************************\nCasabianca is a poem written in the early 19th century by British poet Felicia Hemans (who was, before about 1950, generally credited as "Mrs. Hemans" or "Mrs. F. D. Hemans"). The title of the poem is far, far less familiar than its first line: "The boy stood on the burning deck".\n\nThis poem was a staple of elementary school readers in the United States over a period of about a century spanning, roughly, the 1850s through the 1950s. So often memorized and recited as to lose any shred of meaning or emotion, it is today remembered mostly as a tag line and as a topic of parodies.\n\nThe poem opens:\n\n The boy stood on the burning deck\n Whence all but he had fled;\n The flame that lit the battle's wreck\n Shone round him o'er the dead.\n\n\nThe poem commemorates an actual incident that occurred in 1798 during the Battle of the Nile aboard the French ship L'Orient. The young son Giocante (his age is variously given as ten, twelve and thirteen) of commander Louis de Casabianca remained at his post and perished when the flames caused the magazine to explode.\n\nIn Hemans' and other tellings of the story, young Casabianca refuses to desert his post without orders from his father. (It is sometimes said, rather improbably, that he heroically set fire to the magazine to prevent the ship's capture by the British.) It is not clear how any details of the incident are known beyond the bare fact of the boy's death. Hemans, not purporting to offer a history, but rather a poem inspired by the bare facts, writes:\n\n The flames rolled on—he would not go\n Without his Father's word;\n That father, faint in death below,\n His voice no longer heard.\n\n\nHemans has him repeatedly, and heart-wrenchingly, calling to his father for instructions: "'Say, Father, say/If yet my task is done;'" "'Speak, father!' once again he cried/'If I may yet be gone!;'" and "shouted but once more aloud/ 'My father! must I stay?'" Alas, there is, of course, no response.\n\nShe concludes by commending the performances of both ship and boy:\n\n With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,\n That well had borne their part—\n But the noblest thing which perished there\n Was

Becuase the Koran is a Muslim's Holy Book. Personally I think they should just get rid of this "swearing in on a Holy Book" entirely.

I'm currently in the Air Force stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. You must seriously consider all of your options before you make a decision to enter the military.\n\nFirst off, what are you interested in? I, for example, was interested in computers, so I got into the computer field. I'm actually learning network security which is one of the most interesting things I have ever learned about. My point is, find something that you like doing and see what options the military has for you in that field.\n\nIt's also important to find out what branch of the service you want to go in. The Air Force is known to be a little more relaxed and have jobs that don't require too much stress upon you. We are just as important as any other troop out there, only most of us are safe behind our desks. =P\n\nJust from what you have said, the military sounds like a good option for you, but don't just take my word for it. You say that you want to move around... well, heck... I'm in freakin' Germany right now and I'm having the time of my life! I've traveled to more countries in the past two years than any of my friends have in their entire lives combined. Short on funds? Military pay is known to be pretty weak, but the benefits are endless. They'll pay for college, housing, food, medical, dental... the works. Even if you don't plan on making the military a career, it'll definitely help push you in the right direction.\n\nI hope I helped and good luck to you. If you'd like more information, feel free to contact me via e-mail.
My guess would be B. Many people know what words mean, but they don't use them regularly. \n\nI would guess the narrowest of most people's vocabulaies is their spoken vocabulary.
Tension in the string is the force acting on the string.\n\nFor time being forget about the pulley.\n\nOne end of a rope is tied to a pole at the ground. Suppose you are pulling the rope from the other end.\n\nYou are exerting a force on the rope so as to increase its length.\n\nIf the rope is made of rubber you can see the increase in length.\n\nIf it is a steel rope, you cannot visualize the increase in length; but still it increases in its length. \n\nIf you exert a heavy force the rope breaks into two.\n\nSuppose you are not giving such a force. When the force is within a limit, the rope extends to a length which is determined by the applied force.\n\nWhen the increase in length is stopped, you and the rope are at rest; not moving further. \n\nNow consider the rope alone. What are the forces acting on the rope?\n\nTwo forces are acting on the rope, each at one end of the rope.\n\nSince the rope is not moving, by applying the law of forces, we come to a conclusion that these two forces are equal but opposite.\n\nNote that if the rope is moving with a varying speed, we cannot come to this conclusion.\n\nThe forces in the rope are called tension.\n\nNow suppose you know the value of the force, say 10N, that you have applied to the rope. It is obvious that this force which is pulling the rope and hence the value is 10N.\n\nNow coming to the pulley, a rope is passing through the pulley and one end carries a load and at the other end you are pulling it.\n\nSuppose the load and the end in which you are applying force is at rest ;( not moving)\n\nIi is similar to the above case; instead of the pole to which the rope is tied, here\nthe load is acting as a pole. (The load is also at rest).\n\nSince the system as a whole is at rest. The force you are applying must be equal to the load. Suppose if the load is 10N, you are applying 10N. \n\nActually you are applying 10 N to one end of the rope. The rope must move with this force; but for the load which is pulling it on the opposite direction.\nThus in the rope one end is pulled by you and the other end is pulled by the load.\n\nThe rope is under the tension of 10N force.\n\nNow you know the direction of tension in the rope also.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which load is connected. The load is pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is 10N down ward.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which you are pulling. You are pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is also 10N down ward.\n\nThe pulley is acted on by two forces on either side each equal to 10N, totalling 20N. \n\nIf there is no force acting upward on the pulley, the pulley will come down due the 20 N forces. \n\nTherefore, the pulley is pulled upward by a force of 20N by the one which is connected to the pulley.\n\nIf the load is moving with changing speed, the tension in the rope will be different.\n\nIf the concept of tension when the rope is at rest is understood, then it will be easy if even if the rope is having some acceleration.

The 24kg mass and 13kg mass meet at point x from 24kg mass, and at 4-x from 13kg mass.

The difference is that the catechism of the catholic church teaches love and respect for all people. You have to remember that extremists make all people look bad. Think of Islam. Anyway, you have to take things in context. Look at the fundamental teachings of christ. Read the New Testament, it will be good for you. All religions follow those fundamental teachings, and the only reason for the crusades, and all of those other things you mentioned, was that some extremist's power went to his head and he decided to start making rules. Also bear in mind that if Hitler had died in 1938, he would have been hailed as a hero. (He was Time Magazine's man of hte year in 1938.)

The New Testament teaches of Christ's coming and His instruction to establish His church - I believe there is actually a verse that states "the Churches of Christ salute you" but I can't seem to locate it just now - In answer to your question the bible only refers to Christ's church which was established by the apostles - read the book of Acts - after the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost - and the apostles began the work of preaching the gospel and establishing Christ's church -

Light is a form of energy. It has both the properties of wave as well as particle. A body becomes visible when light is emitted by or reflected from it and this light on entering our eyes enabled us to see the objects. But light itself is invisible. It's the fastest thing in universe. There is no need of any material medium for the transmission of light.
Iodine is not flamable or combustible. It does combine with O2 as an iodate. Iodine is not photosensitive but AgI is photosensitive. there are a number of isotopes.127 is the most common. The others are less massive, in general.(because the atomic mass is 126.9)\n\nSodium has a symbol of Na. Compounds have formulas, such as NaI, sodium iodide.

25 years ago when I was in school we used to feel ashamed to go to a tuition. Only those who were not intelligent are those who took up tuitions.\n\nNow it is the other way round. One reason I personally identify for this is the spread of notion that education is business i.e. commercialisation of education.\n\nSince a number of revenue streams are to be evolved (just like in any business) they created a number of different routes, terms, courses to mint money.\n\nIt is a pity that a student is less (far far less) aware/knowledgeable than a student at the same age (25 years ago)..\n\nIs this development??????????\n\nhttp://www.futureaccountant.com/\nhttp://www.schoolingkids.com/
What is the sixth category. Life is put into five categories, monera, fungi, protists, plants and animals. There are two ways of determining which beings go in which category. The older way is called the phenetic way, in which animals are categorized based on common traits. For instance, all mammals have fur. The more common way of classifying animals is the cladistic way, which groups organisms based on common evolutionary backgrounds. All mammals at one point in development have gill slits, a notochord, etc.

My brothers, sisters and I took care of our father when diabetes took his sight, had 2 heart attacks, was told he only had six months to live, gone through 2 amputations, and damaged his kidneys. My mother has hypertension and kidney failure and I will be there for her until the very end. Some people do not give their parents enough credit for the sacrifices and love that they have given them. I personally believe that placing parents in a home is a terrible resort unless you are completely incapable of taking care of them yourself.
I doubt that, there's people out there right now building the thing and they're doing it with their own sweat, own money(because Bush, 'the guy that can't say 'no', won't say 'no mas' to Mexico), but in fairness the southern states are taking matters into their own hands and getting with the program, too. The sooner people quit bitching and start pitching in to actually solve the problems we're currently having with Mexico, the sooner we can go back to having an open border, but not before. ...

There was a competition to cross the English Channel doing only the breaststroke. \n\nThe three women who entered the race were a brunette, a redhead and a blonde. After approximately 14 hours, the brunette staggered up on the shore and was declared the fastest breaststroker.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled up onto the shore and was declared the second place finisher. \n\nNearly 4 hours after that, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers.\n\nWhen the reporters asked why it took her so long to complete the race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like I'm a sore loser, but I think those two other girls were using their arms."\n\nAnother one!\n\nA Blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so She goes out and buys a gun.\n\nShe goes to his apartment unexpectedly and sure enough, she opens the door and finds him in the arms of a redhead.\n\nWell, the blond is angry, She opens her purse to take out the gun but as she does so, she is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head.\n\nThe boyfriend yells "No, honey, don't do it."\n\nThe blond replies "Shut up, you're next."

For starters, please use spell check so it's easier for people to read your problem in order to help you. \nIt sounds like you need to expand your circle of friends. Time changes things. Friends come and go. Your friends took in a new friend. You didn't say why you don't want to hang with this new kid but you probably have your reasons. Just the same, have you tried being friends with her too?\nDon't hold yourself down to just that one group of friends. If you feel like the fifth wheel in this group, maybe it's time to find some new friends to hang with. I'm not saying to leave your old friends, but just to expand the number of people to hang with.
I would not use the term "magical". "Mystical", perhaps.\n\nEveryone CAN have it. All they have to do is *ask* God. Faith itself is a gift, as you have said. Gifts are freely given (that's what GRACE is all about)...but they must also be freely RECEIVED.\n\nEpistle of James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men liberally, and without reproach; and it shall be given him.\n\n1:6 But let him ask in faith, without wavering. For he who wavers is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.

the moab has been used in afghanistan. well the reason it has not been used in iraq is because they are fighting a urban war with many civilians.
this chapter is important because it shows a different side to Huck, he starts to look at jim as a normal human being instead of a "nigga". This is when he has a battle within himself, between what he was taught by the widow and what he has learned from experience during his journey.

I think it is when it is executed correctly. Today a lot of people are ignorant about the law and their rights so they usually get screwed with out knowing it. My favorite example is watching cops, any episode, half of the stuff the cops do is a violation of the 4th but people don't know it so they go along with whatever the cop says. Every time the cop is questioning the person about the crime with out the suspect waiving his right to legal counsel is a violation and if you watch the show that is all they do. i like to rant.

It is also called Water Cycle.It is the cyclic movement of water on and around our planet Earth.\n 1. Oceans are very large bodies of water.Every day plenty of this is evoperated due to Sun's heat and converted in to clouds.\n 2.Depending upon the seasons and the locations this water vapour is reconverted in to rain drops, snow flakes and returned to the earth.\n3.On the earth is received by rivers and it flows back to the oceans.\n4.A large quantity of the sweet water ic permanently locked in the polar regions and on the mountains.\n This is in short Hydrological cycle.Human life is greatly dependent onit.
No, the poor and middle class are not organized enough, if the unions get strong in this country there might be an uprising.

There's a symptom called chlorophilia where the fibers from your turd remain on your skin, and sink in. Then, a green hue develops up from your feet.

They are politicians, and politicians are all the same - self-centred, and self-serving. They probably sleep fine, because they have no moral fibre.
Not everybody praises people while they are running but there is so much hype with campaign promises and coventions that people just go a little crazy. \n\nBut yes there are always going to be critics and it is just human nature.

I started smoking 9 years ago when I was 14. Both of my parents smoked and I hated them for it. So why did I decide to smoke? Because everyone else was... or so I thought. I wanted to be rebellious and show my friends that I wasn't afraid to do bad things. I'd imagine that's part of the reason young people like us start smoking. Fortunately I was able to quit for some time, but picked it back up because I am addicted. I wish I'd never started in the first place, it's truly an awful habit, and even more awful to break. Just remind yourself how awesome you are for not smoking, and let others make their own mistakes. They'll eventually realize it was a bad choice. I know I did.

Eat less move more. I eat once a day and when I take my daughter to the park or whatever I get up and play with her instead of sitting on the bench like all the other mothers. The whole 2000 cal a day is too much for anyone, you can actually gain weight on 2000 cal a day. To lose weight you want to eat more like 1200 cal a day and 1800 to maintain. Make sure you eat a healthy 1200 cals. Don't eat empty calories.
I was always afraid to speak to you because i thought you were the perfect woman.
Yes, definitely. Comedians can do skits that are hysterical and appropriate when new, but 10, 20 years later the jokes are not funny. Why? Because the times have changed, people have changed (and aged). It's like music - a hit is a great song for awhile. The hit didn't change, but the people/times have. To stay (or get back on the charts), the song needs to be updated, as does the comedian's jokes, if he wants to stay on top.\n\nAn example of how times have changed, might be George Carlin's "Seven Words" skit. There "were" seven words that could not be used on television [Da*n, f*ck, he*l...]. But now, a lot of those words are used without hesitating or censorship, and the skit is not funny (unless you remember those days - or Carlin changes his skit to reflect the difference between then and now -- which he has, I believe).
Well, you didnt give much info on your life and I will assume you live at home. If you do still live at home, you will pretty much have to suck it up until you move out on your own.\n\nAfter about 6 months of "freedom" which means for most new renters/leasers that you are probably about one pay check from being in the streets or mooching off friends, you will probably understand why they were trying to keep you straight with some rules while you were at home.\n\nBasically, they are trying to see you live to be old enough to move out on your own and develop enough responsibility to maintain yourself without becoming a homeless bum when you finally do.
Not saying this to piss anybody off, but if we had younger leaders of different races that were genuinely concerned about the country and problems at hand rather than trying to make it seem as if everyone is out to harm their race, then yes, I think it would be great. They would have to be leaders that have realized that every time something bad happens it does not always have to be about race. Equality is just as violated if someone is given special privleges because they are a "minority". A fresh way of thinking combined with the old way of thinking COULD be great, if the fresh way of thinking can get over trying to convince everyone that they are so mistreated because of past, such as countries we were once at war with or people that were mistreated here over a hundred years ago.
Nordic women are around your height...which is great if you live in Norway.\n\nBut I'm assuming you're North American where the average height of a grown woman is 5'7. So yeah...you're a little tall, but if you're thin as well...then you're set to become a model.

There was a man watching two blonds working very hard one hot summer day.He just could not figure out what they were doing. The first one would dig a hole,then the second one would fill it in. He watched this for a while and he finally had to know. He went up to them and said he thought they were working very hard and had made a lot of progress moving down the walk way of the park and asked what exactly were they doing. Well, said the first one, "We would normally not make this much progress, but the one who has the trees called in sick".
The vast majority of draft bills are NOT passed by both the House and Senate without some sort of modifications.

Women and children are to be treated with the utmost respect according to the Koran (which is not a dirty book). The extremists misinterpret Mohammad's writings to meet their personal needs, just like Christian extremists misinterpret the Bible to meet their personal needs (regarding homosexuality for example). \n\nThe prisoners you're referring to have not yet been convicted of anything, and many have been released over the last 3 years because there was no evidence to hold them, which means there must be more that are being held without evidence as well. Until they're convicted of terrorism, they should be treated as we would want to be treated in that situation (think of the Americans that are kidnapped in Iraq -- we want them treated with respect).\n\nI don't understand why the Afghan government thinks it's ok to execute a man for converting to Christianity. That is not Mohammad's teachings. See the democratically elected government we helped put into place? Pretty similar to the Taliban, isn't it? God help them all.
Yes, everyone has them, just feel your throat. Women's aren't as prominent and usually can't be seen like men's.
Yes. As long as you did not get to the part where you finally submitt the application, there will be not attempts to gather credit information.

The reality is now that normalisation has been happening for 10 years. People are more concerned about increases in domestic taxation (massive increases in Rates and Water charges) than they are about Michael Stone. Thing about Stone is he's a self-publicist. He became a celebratory of sorts for Loyalists after he attacked a funeral in Milltown cemetery years ago and lived for years of this fame. Giving interviews to Sunday newspapers, slagging off his gangster mates (Johnny Adair, Jim Gray), becoming an artist(!), So it was another stunt. Purely to benefit Michael Stone.\nNI Assembly members have been paid £50 million in salaries since the Assembly was shut down. For sitting on their ar$es and waiting for the next election. Local (council) government here works just fine - no different than anywhere else. In January there are more elections were we vote for people to go to an Assembly that doesn't exist. There'll be another round of whataboutery - and they'll fail miserably to agree on what they disagree about. Like they have for the last ten years. No matter what happens here its just not a surprise anymore.

I disagree with some of what Rumsfeld has done, particularly in regard to making our military do more with less and consolidating bases (didn't we learn anything from Pearl Harbor?).

yes. there are many home based businesses out there. me and my business partner specialise in this area to earn money part time in order to create passive income. \n\nthe king of passive income is of course real estate. it will always be like that. however you need the money first to invest in real estate. this is why you are looking for other programs is that correct? the end goal is to ultimately make money from real estate. \n\nplease contact me if you want a list of programs we are actively pursuing at the moment\n\nedit: in the end though it is upto you what you want to do. you cannot sit on your arse and expect money to come through. there is always an element of work to be done. work that nobody else is willing to do. if you do the things that others wont do, you will achieve what others can't have.
Jerseys are tough to size for wearing as streetwear because they're not made to be worn like clothes: they're made to be worn over hockey gear.\n\nI looked online and found a decent sizing chart for you here:\n\nhttp://www.dickssportinggoods.com/sm-hockey-jersey-sizing--bg-1381341.html\n\nIt looks like it breaks down like this:\n\nYour Chest Size (inches)/ Jersey Chest Width (inches)/ Size \n36 44-48 Small \n40 48-50 Medium \n44 50-52 Large \n48 52-24 Extra Large \n52 54-56 XX Large \n\nAs you can see, a 36 chest wears a 44-48 jersey to accomodate gear. Authentic jerseys are just always going to look weird without gear, though. \n\nThere's a whole school of thought (I'm indifferent one way or the other, just for the record) that says that jerseys are to be worn to play hockey, or if you get someone's jersey as a souvenir, you display it but you don't wear it, and that logo gear (team windbreakers, hats, T-shirts) are what you wear to games.\n\nPersonally, if Scott Parker gave me his jersey I'd sleep in it. Every night.\n\nBut... you know... to wear it? It'd look stupid as street clothes. He's like 6'5". I'm 5'4". It'd be down to my knees, like a sack dress.

yeah, he's not over it either. if you want to get over him, you have to cut off all contact, at least until you feel like you don't want to see him anymore. it's probably going to be longer since he still has feelings for you too. and if you were talking about what to do next but you know its not going to work, i wouldn't even put in the effort. if you think it won't work it won't. i think you're just sad cuz you hurt his feelings, because you know it wouldn't work out anyway. just move on.
Breakfast should ideally be the largest meal of the day to provide fuel for the day. Unfortunately in our current civilisation this rarely happens.\n\nYou should also eat 6 small meals a day, and many people, myself included, advise avoiding carbs after 4pm.\n\nI would suggest eating a bigger breakfast, make sure you have a good healthy lunch, and have a small evening meal of grilled meat and salad or fish and salad.\n\nWhen you skip meals, you body gears itself for famine and slows the metabolism, which is not what you want.\n\nAt your age, you can get away with it, but as you get older (and that happens to us all) you will find it harder. Develop GREAT eating habits NOW and they will last you a lifetime.

First we are talking dancing ? If the question is dancing, then here it is in nut shell.Dancing is a very sensual and sexual expression , many women do not feel comfortable putting it all out there for a guy to see, men sometimes assume a woman whom dances that freely , must be the hottest thing in bed, if this is a first date, I am sure she does not want to feel as if, she is leading you on, choose another type of dancing next time for a first date.

It don't matter how good or bad he will be, you are going to remember it for the rest of your life. so you should want to remember the person that you love. Right? I lost my virginity when i was 17. I loved him alot and still i wish that i would have waited. there is nothing to rush into because the first time is not much fun anyways. Well just think about it, its a decision that you have to make and as long as you make the one that you are comfortable with, that is all that matters.

Fish is not considered meat according to Jewish laws, but primarily the biblical support of the notion is in that, aside from fish, there are no specific accounts of Jesus eating meat.\n\nThe old testament suggest that seeds and fruits are men's appropriate diet -Genesis. The prophet Daniel and his companions were vegetarians according to the old testament, and were healthier that way than eating as the king did, based on an informal test mentioned that was conducted by their Babylonian care takers, to make sure they, as advisers to the king, were taking good care of themselves. Ezekiel also mentions food appropriate for vegetarians in the now famous - Ezekiel 4:9.\n\nGenerally speaking, religions which end up widely successful in their efforts to encourage humbleness regard vegetarianism preferable for that purpose, though usually do not require it. The accounts of Jesus in the Gospel support this notion. By suggesting those justified before God are the sinners that can't even lift his face to pray from shame, but still praying humbly, correlates with the saying "The weak man only eats herbs, but the strong man eats anything." Jesus never spoke without Spiritual importance reflected in it.\n\nVegetarianism is encouraged to aid in developing a refined approach to life of the spirit, and is recommended for the humility involved,. St. Paul spoke of nothing being unlawful in truth, but if eating meat offended his fellow men and women, that he'd remain vegetarian for their sake.\n\nThe vegetarian diet is also easier on the land, taking only 1/30 the amount of land for the same amount of nutrition as meat production, since most of the energy from the food goes to the animals rather than the humans intended.
The milky way was first "discovered" (if you can call it that) by using NIR sensors to see through all the dust blocking it from view. Now, by tracking the movements of stars and collecting more data from a whole spectrum of radiation (including measuring redshifts and absorption patterns) we have figured out the shape, size and the position of our solar system within our galaxy.\n\nDon't know if that answers the question at all.

Alright, this sounds like simple miscommunication. First, there is no MOS "Mike 6" - that is an ASI designator to the 91W MOS (which is converting to the 68W MOS). The concept here is that you enlist with the 68W MOS (which is the Army's equivalent to First Responder - in fact the AIT is recognized by the DOT for such purposes), then after some service time BUT BEFORE YOU REACH E-5 (P) RANK (that's Sergeant promotable), you go to the M6 school (M6 is an "Additional School Identifier or ASI) which trains and then licenses you as a licensed practicing nurse (LPN). There is no way to get the M6 ASI without first attending AIT and being qualified as a 68W, then reporting to your unit. If it is not in your enlistment contract, then the M6 school is NOT guaranteed. Instead you will have to apply through your chain of command for it. If it is in your contract than you are set. It doesn't sound like he/she is lying to you but it certainly sounds like there is some miscommunication going on. For further info - I have linked the 91W/68W MOS web site and the M6 ASI websites below. If you are really concerned, do just like you would with a doctor - get a second opinion from a different recruiter in a different city. Sounds like everything is good to go - just confirm that your M6 ASI School is guaranteed in your enlistment contract.
God is god and doesn't have to obey the law. But if he won't obey laws (his own laws) then it will be proov that his laws are not good

Warmongers. I think to a certain extend it's okay- for example I find that studying past wars is fascinating. But people who seek to keep war alive are crazy. I believe there is a line. It is always okay to defend ourselves, our families, and our countries if we are attacked. I'm not so sure about going after people.
Depends on the director. Clint Eastwood, apparently, is happy with only one or two takes. Stanley Kubrick and Terence Mallick have reputations of demanding loads of takes for even the smallest thing.
No, you don't have to worry about it, the virus is trapped and can't execute, however that would drive me nuts. Back up any and all files you want... and reinstall Windows... sure you could go and try to remove it manually but that's just a pain (and you've probably spent more time doing that than you would have reinstalling Windows). But if it won't bother you... then ignore it.

I'M THUPER THANKS FOR ASKING!!!!\nand giggling uncontrollably, but you knew that\n~sashays out of the closet and into the !BODY! of my tall tale~\n\nAs you well know, I can totally relate to this...from a fabulously different angle, however. I, Dr Rich Amblaeu, am both a blessing and a curse to all monogamous, heterosexual relationships....regardless of their stability. I've earned the title 'LadyKiller' and you may rest-assured that I live up to it. The anticipation of ripping a woman's hunk-of-a-man out of her arms, out of her life, and into complete and TOTAL submission causes the sun to shine where the sun shouldn't shine...if you know what I'm saying (and I know you do).\n\nI shall render her powers useless against him, thereby thrusting her into a state of helplessness. Upon doing so, my third leg instantly stands at attention, front and center. I then violate the man from the outside in, then from the inside out...over and again until he curses the day that he was born.\n\nThe various positions, restraints, toys, and locations (physically and geographically) that we use can be seen as the many courses of a single meal. All are vital in satisfying the appetite, however a lingering thirst doth remain. The only remedy that will effectively quench that thirst, is to literally drink the sweet milk of her tears.\n\nOnce I have demeaned and deviled her 'significant other'....demoralized her 'relationship' in every way possible (emotionally, physically, spiritually, mentally, intellectually)\n...only then do the tears begin to flow. Then and only then am I able to consummate MY marriage, one between appetite and thirst.\n\nTo lick the tears from her face, to literally suck them from her eyes....that is what it takes to satisfy my palate. Oh the sweet milk of a relationship gone sour, driven to the brink and forced over the edge by yours truly....\n\nOregon's Biggest Gayest LumberJack\nPresident of the Orgeon Chapter of NAMBLA\nProctologist Extraordinaire\nMary Kay - Customer Disservice MVP\n\n-BIG GAY RICH, MD

You're going to get a lot of different answers from a lot of different people (most of them will probably contain either the words "Jesus" or Bible" in them).\n\nAll I can say to you is this: read a lot, do some research, learn, and ask lots of questions. If it's a faith that you're seeking, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.\n\nBeliefnet has some great quizzes along the lines of "What religion am I?" and some other good stuff too. Give them a shot! I hope you find what you're looking for :)
Its a mathematical function which converts the time domain data stream into the frequency domain (spectrum).\n\nOnce the spectral peaks have been identified, fixes and mods become pretty obvious. In addition, one can create a stored baseline, and if a different spectral content is obsered, you know something has changed, and the frequencys of interest, can help you pin point the problem. An FFT analysis can predict early bearing failure, as well as hardnening of the mouting surfaces.

Use Gentain and Dandelion root as well as Milk Thistle all together in combination, in equal parts in a tea. These are all good detox herbs. They tea will taste foul but this is the most potent way to get the herbs. Drink a cup 3-5 times daily. Keep up the vitamins and electrolytes as well. \n\nAlso on the end of the index fingernail on the inside (thumb side) is the accupuncture point for the beginning of the large intestine meridian, tap here around 20 times, then on the side of the hand where you would hit if you did a karate chop, this is the small intestine meridian point, tap here straight after tapping the index finger. keep doing this repeatedly as often as you can throughout the detox, it help tremedously.\nBest of luck.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.
Well, first off Rodeo 5's are actually easier than Rodeo 3's. It may sound weird but if you throw into it right you'll come out of your cork better backwards than forwards. \n\nTo practice, start off with frontside 180's. Make sure you have these down so well you can land them in your sleep. The next obvious step is to move up to frontside 3's and then start trying 5's. When you are comfortable with fs 5's you can start thinkin' about getting corked.\n\nRodeo's, like Misty Flips and other off axis spins are all about your shoulders. As you approach the lip of your jump you want to go from base flat and load up your toeside edge. You will be popping off your toes. As you begin your spin you need to drop your leading shoulder back and down while bringing your back foot up. I find that it helps to point back at the lip with your leading hand and grab Indy (obviously with your trailing hand and I'm sure you know to never, ever grab tindy). Don't reach down for the grab so much as bring your board up to your hand (I will actually reach pretty much straight out for my board), this will help with the off axis rotation. At this point you'll be completely blind for a landing if you were going for a three, hang on to your board for the last bit of rotation and don't let go until you spot the landing. As you come out 5 it'll be right in front of you. At this point remember back to the frontside 180's that you can now land in your sleep because that is all that is left to do. \n\nWhen watching what the pro's are doing in the videos pay close attention to their shouldes, hands and feet. That is where it all comes from. I would suggest practicing this on a kicker into powder and not in the park as it isn't a very natural feeling spin and you will more than likely come up short the first couple of times.\n\nGood luck and it's nothing like a backflip, it's much harder but way more styley

Neither could win, especially Condi. She is damaged goods and so full of crap. But the right female could win. She is internationally known, intelligent, connected, well spoken, educated, media friendly, yet not one of the good ole boys like Hillary. The answer you ask? Maria Shriver. She runs as a democrat, keeps Teddy boy out of the picture, but leverages the Kennedy name and Arnold can bail from CA to become the 1st gentleman.

In the 400 it is a sprint.... but you have different phases of the race... your drive, hard stride, and kick... a huge mistake people make is they come out too slow and by that time the race is lost or they use too much energy i the beginning and die at the end only to get passed in the last few steps. In the 4 people normally come out hard...hard stride the back stretch and kick at whatever distance they can ( 100, 150, 200)... The 100 hurdles just try to stay low to the hurdles and have a clean race, maintain good form and attack the hurdles... make sure your step after you jump the hurdle is used to keep momentum going so you aren't stopping and restarting and have fun! If I confused you or if you have anymore questions let me know!

That definately the first step and its definately the hardest step. It really sucks and often on the path to recovery you can start feeling worse before you feel better, don't let that get you down...\n\nOften times just talking to someone can help. \nIf you are anxious let yourself worry only once during the day and write it all down, every time you are anxious writing it down can help a lot and just talking about it. \n\nGood luck

I grew up in northern Ohio, and all winter long we played hockey on a little pond in the neighborhood.

The fourth answer is the correct answer. A company can not declare profit on their own stocks, even if they buy back at 5 and sell it at $50, not $1 of it will be in income, just additional capital and higher owner's equity. The company itself has no good reason to declare a dividend or a buyback, it helps the share holders only. With less shares outstanding Earnings per share goes up, and that way the company price goes up. It's a way to increase the share price of the company despite no growth, or little growth. Most big companies who have slow growth, but high cash flow make up their slow growth by dividends and buy backs.
Wow you sound a little conceited in your ideals for yourself. Whose judgments are using to gauge your results. I find it hard to believe that you never hurt anyone.

I don't mean to ever hurt anyone, but I know that I have when I have said things in anger, or said something without thinking. I am as good as I can be I guess. Far from perfect, perfectly human.

Whether you are a restricted or unrestricted free agent in the NBA depends on the amount of time you have in the league when your current contract expires. If you have a certain amount of service time then you can become an unrestricted free agent, meaning that you can sign with any team for any amount of money. If you have less than the prescribed time in the league than you can shop around with other teams and get an offer for yourself. However, if your current team matches that offer in the time alotted, then you have to go and play for them. That is the difference. I am not sure what amount of service in the league you have to have to qualify for unrestricted free agency.

Large molecules are difficult for the body to absorb into the bloodstream. By digesting the large molecules into smaller ones, they can be absorbed much more quickly and efficiently. This lets us get more nutrients out of the food we eat.\n\nAlso, in the case of proteins, the way that amino acids are arranged in proteins doesn't match the arrangement that our body needs for certain things. The protein is broken down into the amino acids to be absorbed, and then those amino acids can be used to build up proteins that meet the exact specifications that your body needs them to have.

On February 20, 1998, that Raman Lamba, fielding close to the bat, copped one on the skull off the bat of Mehrab Hossain. Lamba, playing for Abahani Limited after retiring from a long first-class career with Delhi, had just come up to forward short leg, and did not wear a helmet, contending that he only had three balls to field in that position. \n\nMehrab, who would later go on to play for Bangladesh, was batting for Mohammedan and struck a short ball fiercely. The ball was hit with such power that it ricocheted off Lamba's head, and ballooned to Khaled Mashud, the wicketkeeper, who had to backpedal to take the catch. \n\nLamba, shaken and with an understandably nasty headache, dusted himself off, picked himself up and walked off the ground unassisted. When he reached the changerooms, the team doctor laid Lamba down, and gave him a glass of water to drink. By this time the hemorrhaging had begun. Finally, when the gravity of the situation became obvious, Lamba was taken to the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research, then considered the best centre for neurology in Bangladesh. But by then, it was too late.

Only a honeybee dies after it stings. No other kind of bee dies after it stings once. All other types of bees have smooth stingers. Once they sting you, they pull their stingers right back out. A honeybee's stinger, however, has a hook on the end. When a honeybee stings something and flies away, the stinger stays hooked in the flesh of the animal it just stung. Soft parts of the honeybee's body pull off with the stinger, and the bee soon dies.

It is puzzling as to why Bush's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see. Because certainly it's obvious: no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found (unless the U.S. plants them); nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States. So that mission wasn't accomplished. And it's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians haven't been liberated, unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States, liberation. Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks, liberation. Or going without sufficient food, water or medical care, liberation. Or having an interim government imposed on you, liberation. So that mission, unfortunately, wasn't accomplished either.\nPretty pathetic scorecard. But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner "Mission Accomplished," they had to have accomplished something. So as Mr. Bush dragged on with his insipid speech, one would continue ponder what exactly was the mission? And then it hits, as clear as day, or rather, as "black" as night: the oil! the Texas tea! the Bush-Cheney life-blood! Mission CERTAINLY was accomplished!!!!!!!!

The Bob commercials are not for Viagra, are they? I thought they were for some other form of medication. Did you know, if all the money, time & energy spent on trying to keep mens' d*%$s hard was to be spent on cancer or diabetes research & medicines, they probably could eliminate them?? All of the pills, potions, pumps, implants, etc - all of that stuff. Is any of it necessary? If an old fart can't get wood & finish the job, is that such a big loss? Men should just accept that it's a part of aging & let it go. But NO! we have to spend billions of dollars on penises & pleasure, while little children die from cancer & diabetes runs rampant.

you are both wrong, the term for people with both male and female organs is " hemaphrodite" It is a person born with both ovaries and testicles and mixed male and female organs. transgender refers to a person that has had a operation to change from one to another.
baby girl, this will only force you to grow up faster. many of us had endure the teasing, laughing, and being part of the outcast. kids can be mean. especially if you're different. you have to block them out and do things that would improve yourself. not for them remember, it's for you. and you don't want to be part of their shallow group anyways. be strong for now, until you are sucessful in life, then only then you can say that you'd turned out better than them. so, endure it for awhile, find people who see you beyond your appearance. in the same time you have to have a thicker skin. trust me, if you tell them off now, there are more to come. i'm sorry baby girl, these people will force you to grow up faster.

Clostridium shows optimimum growth when plated on blood agar at human body temperatures. When the environment becomes stressed, however, the bacteria produce spores that tolerate the extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot.\n\nClostrium species also form spores which survive boiling water, but the Closterium species can not form spores in the presence of oxygen. Most clostridia are aerotolerant (they survive exposure to air), but most species of Clostridium do not resume growth if oxygen is present.\n\nMinimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins were determined in chemically defined medium for five strains of Clostridium difficile. Cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, tryptophan and valine were essential amino acids for growth of C. difficile. Arginine, glycine, histidine, methionine and threonine enhanced growth. Biotin, pantothenate and pyridoxine were essential vitamins. A defined medium containing the minimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins produced a rapid and heavy growth which was comparable to that in modified brain heart infusion, a complex medium. Adenine was able to substitute for glycine and threonine, suggesting that the two amino acids may be utilized as precursors of purine nucleotides. The defined medium developed here will assist physiological and biochemical studies on C. difficile.

Well, as long as she can get a regular job here fairly quickly she should be fine. 3000 pound is about 7,500 Aus dollars which is enough to put a deposit on a rental house and pay the rent for a little while (depending on which city she moves to - e.g. Sydney is really expensive, Adelaide is pretty good and Hobart is quite cheap) and probably get a few essential items like a fridge, bed, chair... She might have to do it tough for a while but if she is prepared to work hard she could probably do it. It is going to be quite difficult with a baby though - child care can be very expensive here.

I have lived in an area where there is a total smoking ban in restaurants and bars...actually any public place and it's great. The way I look at it I have a RIGHT to breathe smokers need to respect that right.

I know my friends and I ... all non smokers go out much more now that we know we won't come home smelling of second hand smoke.

Actually there is no superconductor at room temperature(at least at this time being).\n\nhave u ever heard about Ohm's law\nohm's law stated that the voltage(V) is equal to electric current(I) and resistance(R)\n V=IR\nif we manipulate the law, we get\n R=V/I\n\nIt means that we cannot have voltage and current without having resistance.\n\nWe don't want the resistance bcoz we didn't want to waste the voltage. in other word, material with high resistance is called insulator and the ones with low resistance is called conductor. we know electric can't pass trough insulator becoz it dont conduct electric. Unfortunately, all material in the universe have resistance. Wood n plastic have resistance so they cannot conduct electric. Metals such as cuprum, iron n so on also have resistance but in lower scale. therefore it can conduct electric but it also waste electric in form of heat. so everyday when we use elecrical gadjets we waste some electric.\n\nSuperconductor is the material that has 0 or as low as achievable resistance. Scientists find out that the lower the temperature the lower the resistance. so we can have 0 resistance at 0 kelvin or -273.15 centrigate.\n\nScientists have managed to find a combination of materials that can act as superconductor above 0 kelvin(or above -273.15 centrigate). i'm not remember but i think it is -100 something, centrigate. But until right now, no one has manage to find the right combination of materials to make superconductor at room temperature.\n\n\nShould we manage to make one, the whole world will get the benefits from it. Imagine a world without elecrical power crisis and computer that can process much much faster than today n the elecric gadjets that use low power, lower than \nany weakest battery in the world today. What it would be?\n\nUntil then, we can only use slow computer to log on to Yahoo!Answer.. haha..

Your basic selection criteria start with flow rate @ pressure. This is going to depend on what you are trying to do, but you will find a direct correlation between the horsepower input of the pump motor and the combination of flow at pressure. Note that it is possible to make low flow at high pressure, or low pressure at high flow, but it takes a lot of power to both.\n\nA suggestion is to calculate the amount of power your require (force X distance / unit of time) and convert that to horsepower, then look for an HPU at www.Grainger.com that is about 2X that horsepower.

Hello:\nThis is in response to the question you posted about curing hemorrhoids.\nActually, there is really no cure for them, except maybe for surgery where they basically take a rubber band and place it around the lesion until it dies and falls off but there are other forms of surgery as well.\nAS I said, there is really no cure but there a many things you can do to either prevent recurrence or the amount of time between exacerbations.\nProbably the most important is increasing the amount of fiber in your diet. If you are like most Americans, I diet is horrendous and we dont get nearly the amount of fiber we need. You can supplement with either Konsyl-D, Benefiber, Metamucil (I find personally that benefiber is the best because it doesnt have a bad taste and it doesnt turn into a gelatinous material that you have to force down.\nOther things that can exacerbate hemorrhoids are heavy lifting and sitting too long without getting up and walking around. Especially on airplanes or long car trips. The other thing that is a must is lots and lots of water at least eight glasses of water per day minimum.\nI dont know what kind of hemorrhoids you have. There are actually two forms: internal and external. The external are the ones you can actually see hanging out and are very painful, itchy and down right aggravating. Then the internal ones which are completely painless and tend to bleed more. Most of the time people dont even know they have internal hemorrhoids until they go to their doctors complaining of blood in their stool, then a colonscopy is done and thats when they find them.\nTry as best as you can to keep from getting constipated. The pushing and straining you do can worsen hemorrhoids. That is where the plenty of water and fiber come into play.\nAny food that is high in fiber will help. Bran, oats, wheat germ, celery, corn (yes even popcorn without the butter and salt of course).\nI hope this helped you with your question. it was my pleasure to answer it for you.\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.

Find the moles of Al:\n\nn = m/Ar = 10/27 = 0.37 mol (approx) where Ar = 27 is the relative atomic mass of Al.\n\nFind the moles of HCl:\n\nn = C*V = 6*0.1 = 0.6 mol HCl\n\nAccording to the balanced chem. equation:\n\n2Al + 6HCl --> 2AlCl3 + 3H2\n\n1 mol of Al reacts with 3 mol of HCl, so\n0.37 mol of Al reacts with 3*0.37 = 1.11 mol of HCl\n\nSo HCl is the limiting reactant and because:\n\n6 mol of HCl produces 3 mol H2\n0.6 mol of HCl produces 0.3 mol H2\n\nThis quantity - 0.3 mol of H2 - at STP occupies:\n\nV = n*Vm = 0.3*22.4 = 6.72 L, where Vm = 22.4 L/mol is the molar volume in STP.

Hold on a minute. Rex Grossman has more touchdown passes than he does interceptions. Granted, he has been playing subpar compared to the beginning of the season, but that's to be expected. He's in his first year as a starting quarterback. People are beginning to figure out how to play against him. Once he learns to read defenses, he will be an excellent quarterback. He has an amazing accurate arm; he just needs to learn to use it. Give him time, and he'll be a great quarterback.\n\nAlso, the Bears are 9-2. I don't see them getting rid of a quarterback that is leading the team with a record like that. If anything, they should think about replacing Brian Urlacher because he's getting old and won't be nearly as good in 3 or 4 years.

I think the question you are asking is can something with no mass produce a force on an object. The answer is yes. A photon has no mass but it has energy. It's energy is equal to a constant times the frequency. This might seem a bit odd at first but if you have ever been into a science store they will probably have a light bulb with a vacume inside with a pinwheel going round and round. What is actually pushing the pinwheel is light because light it turns out will cause pressure on an object which we call radation pressure. \n\nYou are probably confused at this point since force = mass*acceleration, but mass is equal to energy -- remember E=mc^2, which we sometimes write as E=m by setting the speed of light equal to one. This means that you can actually create a massive particle from light -- this is called pair creation. It happens when a high energy photon becomes an electron and positron. Also, when fission occur the opposite happens -- part of the mass becomes energy in the form of light.

'Little House in the Big Woods' is the first book in the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. This is what's on the back of the book:\n\n"Wolves and pnathers and bears roamed the deep Wisconsin woods in the 1860's. Still, Laura Ingalls' father perferred to live miles away from the nearest neighbors. So Pa built a snug cabin for Ma, Laura, mary and Baby Carrie. He hunted and trapped and farmed. Ma made her own cheese and sugar. All night long, the wind holwed lonesomely, but Pa played his fiddle and sang, keeping the family safe and cozy."\n\nIt's basically a story about a Laura and her family's adventures of living in a cabin in the woods. It mostly covers daily life, the excitement of going to town, special events such as Christmas and dances, and harvest. I loved this series as a child and I just reread it last year. I highly recommend it.

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that gradually steal sight without warning. In the early stages of the disease, there may be no symptoms. Experts estimate that half of the people affected by glaucoma may not know they have it.\n\nVision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. This nerve acts like an electric cable with over a million wires. It is responsible for carrying images from the eye to the brain.\n\nThere is no cure for glaucoma—yet. However, medication or surgery can slow or prevent further vision loss. The appropriate treatment depends upon the type of glaucoma among other factors. Early detection is vital to stopping the progress of the disease.\n\nIt was once thought that high pressure within the eye, also known as intraocular pressure or IOP, is the main cause of this optic nerve damage. Although IOP is clearly a risk factor, we now know that other factors must also be involved because even people with “normal” levels of pressure can experience vision loss from glaucoma.

Well over the long term- people's attitude toward the military. During the Viet Nam era, military people were treated very badly (and this is really an understatement).

Steve Perry was not the original lead singer\n\nDuring its initial 14 years of existence (1973-1987), Journey altered its musical approach and its personnel extensively while becoming a top touring and recording band. The only constant factor was guitarist Neal Schon (b. Feb. 27, 1954), a music prodigy who had been a member of Santana in 1971-1972. The original unit, which was named in a contest on KSAN-FM in San Francisco, featured Schon, bassist Ross Valory, drummer Prairie Prince (replaced by Aynsley Dunbar), and guitarist George Tickner (who left after the first album). Another former Santana member, keyboard player and singer Gregg Rolie, joined shortly afterwards. \n\nhttp://www.steve-perry.com/\nwww.steveperryfanclub.homestead.com
Self hypnotize yourself to sleep. Close your eyes. Picture a place that makes you the most happy..mountains,beach,green pastures, something you can picture in detail. Then begin to 'build' it in your mind. Begin with things closest to you and then work outwards, and as you imagine outwards imagine yourself moving slowly forward. It helps if you think the sentence"slowly I walk....." as you move outwards.\n Best way to describe it is for me to tell you mine I guess. I imagine the sky dark,the only light being the moon..it's full. I hear the ocean as it comes in and out. Slowly I walk toward it feeling cool sand on my bare feet. I creep closer and closer to the shoreline. First just my toes get submerged in the warm water, then my calves(you have to actually see and hear your imagery it'll take practice before you can do it real good.) Long imagery short I eventually end up fully submerged and swim slowly to the very bottom of the water where there is a small pin prick of light (the pinprick of light is important you need it in yours too) I slowly make my way to it and as I move closer it gets gradually bigger. If I'm still awake after I reach it I imagine going through it until I am on the other side which is sky blue and I 'float' through the air. You have to make your senses cooperate with you...hearing smelling and feeling everything imagined. This really works and it's a technique I read in a book years ago when I was younger. Can't remember the book just the technique. It puts me to sleep every time and everyone I have shared it with has found peaceful slumber also. Oh big detail make sure your room is quiet and dark unless the dark bothers you.
Stalactites are formed from the deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions. The corresponding formation on the floor underneath a stalactite is known as a stalagmite. Given enough time, these formations can meet, resulting in a formation known as a column or pillar.Every stalactite begins with a single mineral-laden drop of water. When the drop falls, it leaves behind the thinnest ring of calcite. Each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring. Eventually, these rings form a very narrow (0.5 mm), hollow tube commonly known as a "soda straw" stalactite. Soda straws can grow quite long, but are very fragile. If they become plugged by debris, water begins flowing over the outside, depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar cone-shaped stalactite. The same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below, eventually resulting in a rounded or cone-shaped stalagmite. Unlike stalactites, stalagmites never start out as hollow "soda straws."

I live in the New Orleans area. Housing is SCARCE right now. Many people are looking to rent, possibly short-term (12 mos. or so). Property taxes are not that high, at least they weren't before Katrina, but then again, our streets, public service, and schools suck.\n\nIF you find any units, chances are you'll have to do some fixing up. Need a contractor? Get on a list and wait 3 or 4 months before they come out. Doing it yourself? Stand in line at Home Depot or Lowe's for an hour or so for each trip - IF they have what you want.\n\nI am not trying to discourage you - contrary to what you may think - I just want to paint a realistic picture for you. My children's school just had their roof replaced from hurricane Katrina - in MARCH. Times are tough... but we need people to help rebuild with us... and have lots of patience. Good luck.

the indigenes of the niger delta want to control their resources b'cos Gov't has done very poorly in giving them comensurate dividends for the loss of their land.\nthey have really bad roads, mostly no light, no ptable water, they can't farm their lands etc... yet the federation makes tons of cash on a daily basis selling the oil that is mined from their land.\nhowever, it is also important to realise that they are mostly being sold out by their own kinsmen & elders who go to meet with Govt on their behalf.

Depending on the nature of the business, the entire advantage likely lies in the information the business has. Information about the product, information about the industry, information about the customer.\n\nInformation really is what determines the success or failure of a company. With that, it's clear why the information needs to be protected. As it is currently there is no "perfect" protection. All two-way encryption methods can be deciphered, however some much more easily than others.\n\nBottom line, the better the encryption, the less likely you are to have your information discovered and (in the worst case) used against you.

what should you do? what do you want to accomplish? do you want to make your ex jealous or did you want to remain friends and feel that if hes jealous, than it could spoil everything? do you want him back in your life, so the new-found interest is welcomed or are you afraid hes going to stalk you and your new guy and the thought is frightening?\n\nthe easiest answer is always the most difficult to do, communication. i have a feeling if you think it might be jealousy, it probably is. though, sometimes theres no way to remain friends after a break-up, if you do.. you need to lay it all out on the table. you probably know the best way to handle this situation.

I say JT. I think people underestimate Jermain because of his poor (but victorious) showings against Bernard Hopkins. Yes, Taylor looked bad in those fights, but Bernard Hopkins makes everyone look bad, and yet he still lost to Taylor twice. I think we will see a much different Jermain this fight, especially since he his under the helm of Emmanuel Steward. Not to take anything away from Wright, he is a world class boxer and a seasoned veteran, yet I do not see him having the strength or the hand speed to defeat Taylor, especially if Taylor can keep that jab on him. Wright's gonna have to get inside to win this fight, and Taylor's gonna do everything he can to keep the smaller, shorter man at a distance. Either way it should be a much better fight then the last middleweight title fight.

Behavioural based questions are a good indicator of their relevant experience, as it focuses on actual situations versus academic theoretical situations. For example, you could ask a question like "Tell me about a time when you did something extra to improve a patron's experience." or "Tell me about a time when you did more that was required of you." Those who can't answer these well suggests to you that they don't have the experience or understanding to do the job well. With such questions, you'll find the people with the right attitude as well as the people who actually know about what you are asking.
Several years ago I had an unusual experience concerning an uncle, a distant relative who lived over a thousand miles away. \n\nWhile driving my car I suddenly felt the unmistakable presence of this relative that I hardly even knew. He was more like someone I had heard about than someone I knew. It was very strange; it felt as though I was momentarily lifted right out of my physical body. I seemed to be suspended somehow beyond space and time, bathed in a love so intense It felt like I could have just disappear into it at any moment if It would have let me. It only lasted for a few seconds, but it seemed to last forever at the same time. I realize how crazy this must sound. The experience was so strong that at first I was afraid I was loosing my grip on reality. I finally managed to chalk it up to an over active imagination.\n\nThree days later I got a call from my aunt telling me that this uncle we are talking about had gone into a coma and died the day I had the experience. It felt like ice water had been poured down my back when she told me this. I had lost any real ideas of God or faith and had become somewhat of an atheist. Needless to say this experience caused me to rethink some of the conclusions I had come to. \n\nI feel blessed to now understand that even in our darkest confusion something loves us so much that it went out of its way to assist me and bring me back to a state of absolute certainty about Gods love for us.\nDuring the experience it seemed like there was a vast amount of information that I was somehow allowed access to. One thing that I came away from this experience understanding beyond any shadow of a doubt was that any Idea that God is unhappy with us or would judge or allow us to be punished for any reason is simply impossible. \n\nI can’t explain the love I felt with words. They simply don’t make words big enough or complete enough to do this. The only way I can begin to convey this love to you is to say that there was simply nothing else there. Nothing but love. No hint of judgment, no displeasure of any sort. It is as though God sees us as being as perfect as we were the day we were created. It is only in our confused idea of ourselves that we seem to have changed.\n\n I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck. Love and blessings. \n\nYour brother don

In my opinion you could do something in power point with some of the most public news and try to find the same news in different newspapers and how does the media change ther version according to the side they support (for example a newspaper that agrees with the republicans and other that agrees with the democrats). A graphical example it would be in 1982 there was a war between The UK and Argentina, and there were different versions, here the media said that wew were winnig, when the reality was that the UK was... that is the best that i can give you. Good Luck on your presentation!!
Michael Jackson used to be a decent pop star. But, as with many celebrities, their 'screen' persona is completely different from the person underneath. Michael Jackson, as a person, is insecure and has strange obsessive desires and behaviors. Michael Jackson, as a pop star, is a decent musician and knows how to put together good pop music.\n\nThe reality is, you have to be willing to distinguish the pop-star persona of MJ from the real person that is MJ. There are basically two different people: the MJ on we see on stage and in videos (a persona created by the music industry) and the MJ in real life who dangles babies, hangs out with children and is obsessed with plastic surgery.

Amazing how many people still proclaim that heaven is in an unknown, non physical place, even when the bible very clearly states that it is a solid structure in the sky, separating the 'high waters' from the 'low waters' ie it holds back the rain until god opens the heavens. Just another example of how man twists the bible in attempt to justify it.
No, absoutely not. The arguement for it will be to keep the middle east stable, and if anything the past few years have shown that to be an impossible goal. The concern is that if things go down in flames over their, it will create a shambles of the US economy and lifestyle, and a major redistribution of wealth with many people loosing, both rich and poor, and a potential destabilization of our own government.\n\nI think that attitude is selling US citizens short. We will recover, just as they did during the depression. If anything we'll get to see a snapshot of the future as gas prices head towards $7/gallon. Life will go on, just differently. If the middle east takes a header, and everything collapses, we wil be fine, but the power brokers obviously won't be.

The Soviet Union cut off access by land to West Berlin in an attempt to capture that portion of the city, which was under French/British/American control.

Is it supposed to say it is thrown from an initial height of 5 feet? The path of the ball will be in the form of a parabola y=ax^2 + bx + c where\n\na = 1/2 the force of gravity (gravity is -32 feet/second^2, so -16 feet/second^2)\nx = time, so in this case 2\nb = the velocity\nc = the initial starting height\n\nSo just plug in your numbers and solve\n\n= -16*(2^2) + 35*2 + 5\n= -64 + 70 + 5\n= 11 feet\n\nOh, and the function would be h(t) = -16t^2 + 35t + 5
Electric current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in an electric circuit, measured in coulombs/second which is named amperes.\n\nA transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy from one circuit to another by magnetic coupling with no moving parts. A transformer comprises two or more coupled windings, or a single tapped winding and, in most cases, a magnetic core to concentrate magnetic flux. Transformers are used to convert between high and low voltages, to change impedance, and to provide electrical isolation between circuits.
depends. pc2700 is better because it is faster memory than pc2100. But, remember, if you have a pc/laptop that accepts pc2100, then you can put a pc2700 memory in it but it will not make your laptop faster. It works only because all memory modules are backward compatible and work with old slots but will not be able to take advantage of the speed capabilities of the newer memory modules.

Its equivalent to proving\nm*n = (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) )\n\nNow, i'll have to use basic number theory. The idea is to show that the number of times a prime factor of m*n occurs on the LHS is equal to the number of times a prime factor of (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ) occurs on the RHS.\nNote : LHS = Left Hand Side\n RHS = Right Hand Side\n\nFor any prime factor p of m*n, call it p. Now say p occurs to the power of h in m and power of k in n. That is to say m "contains" p^h while n contains p^k. Note that h,k are nonnegative integers. \n\nNow, in lcm(m,n), we would choose p^ [ min(h,k) ] while\nin gcd(m,n) we would choose p^ [ max(h,k) ] \nNote that min (h,k) means minimum of h and k, similarly max (h,k)means maximum of h and k . For example, if h=2 and k=3, then min (2,3) = 2. while max(2,3) = 3. If say h = k, then obviously in both lcm and gcd of m*n we choose p^h to be in its product. This is true for EVERY prime factor of m*n.\n\nSo, consider the product (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ).\nFor EACH prime factor p of m*n, we have shown above that it occurs as { p^ [ min(h,k) ] } * { p^ [ max(h,k) ] }, that is our RHS product contains \n p^ [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = p^(h+k)\nNow, in our LHS, p occurs as p^h * p^k = p^(h+k) too!!!\nThus, we have shown for each prime factor, p of m*n, it occurs as the same product in both the LHS and RHS. And thus\nwe have LHS = RHS. Done.\n\nOne question may circle in your mind, that is how i know that [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = (h+k)\nWell, this is a fact.\n\nFurther, if you want to show it, consider 3 cases.\n\nCase 1. ( h = k)\nHere min(h,k) = min(h,h) = h\nand max(h,k) = max(h,h) = h\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = h + h = 2h.\nAnd (h+k)= h + h = 2h.\n\nCase 2. ( h < k)\nHere min(h,k) = h, because h is smaller.\nand max(h,k) = k, because k is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = h + k \n\nCase 3. ( h > k )\nHere min(h,k) = k, because k is smaller.\nand max(h,k) = h, because h is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = k + h
A side stitch is a piercing sensation just below the ribcage, usually felt when you're running. In the past, several different theories tried to explain the cause: trapped gas, swollen liver, stomach muscle cramps. However a recent and fairly conclusive theory holds that strain on the ligaments connecting the liver to the diaphragm is the cause. \nThe liver "hangs" from the diaphragm by fibrous bands called ligaments. Running exerts a steady downward force on your liver, stretching these ligaments. In addition, when you exhale (usually as your left foot hits the ground), your diaphragm is pushed up. That means your liver falls with gravity as your diaphragm rises, placing considerable strain on those poor ligaments. \n\nThe result? A stitch. The cure? Stop running immediately and press your hand just below the pain. This should raise your liver up, relieving the strain on the ligaments. Inhale and exhale evenly as you press down. \n\nAs a preventive measure, take deep, full breaths while running. If you take shallow breaths, your diaphragm is consistently raised, which wreaks havoc on your ligaments. Exercise is great, but remember to be kind to the rubber bands keeping your organs in place.

Minerals are natural compounds formed through geological processes. The term "mineral" encompasses not only the material's chemical composition, but also the mineral's structure. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms (organic compounds are excluded). The study of minerals is called mineralogy. To be classified as a "true" mineral, a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure. It must also be an inorganic, naturally-occurring, homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural resources are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their relatively unmodified (natural) form. A commodity is generally considered a natural resource when the primary activities associated with it are extraction and purification, as opposed to creation. Thus, mining, petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry are generally considered natural-resource industries, while agriculture is not. Natural resources are often classified into renewable and non-renewable resources.

Following the Buddha and the Dharma (teaching), the community of Buddhist monks and nuns, or sangha, constitute the third of the Threefold Refuge, a basic creed of Buddhism. Their behavior is strictly disciplined by the sacred canon. These monks and nuns adopt distinctive styles of appearance and behavior. \n\nThere were a variety of reasons for joining a monastery or nunnery. Pursuit of spiritual salvation and enlightenment was obviously an important reason for leaving secular homes. But some people also believed that Buddhist monastic life would be the best way to serve their social and economic needs. Widows, orphans and other displaced members of society could find refuge in Buddhist institutions.

Perhaps he wants to do something more romantic, but feels *silly* doing it - again a result of his growing-up environment.\n\nThink of all those things, and try to answer the question "why" is he passing out on the couch instead of spending time with the woman he married. That might get you the answers you need.

Well starting a rumor is certainly not a very good sign of friendship. To me it means that you care about one another and will do all you can to be of help to each other. You would expect to be treated as you treat. Real friends are hard to come by, it seems all people do anymore is use people. I know of one person who says we are friends (but we aren't in my opinion) but all she wants is something from me or from all her other friends. Each friend has a specialty thing, one is a carpenter, another a photographer another a hairdresser and the list goes on. What does she do for them, nothing at all. That is not a friend that is a leech. Friends are someone you can count on no matter what the situation. They will be with you through tough times and fun times and their feelings will only change for the better. sorry that your friends are so shallow, but some day when they need a friend they will find no one to talk with..

talk to your doctor about a healthy plan for you, but please, don't obsess over this, just eat healthy foods and get exercise (play a sport, swim, walk the dog everyday, participate in gym class, etc.). drink plenty of water, try replacing unhealthy snacks (potato chips, chocolate bars) with better ones (carrots, bananas, yogurt, an egg, wheat crackers, you get the idea). if you are obese, your doctor should tell you how to safely get to a healthy weight. if you are just trying to lose a few pounds, relax, your body is okay, after puberty, if you continue to have a healthy lifestyle, your body will look better (a little fat is common, and even good, so don't worry). if you are concerned about your weight, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist. and whatever you do, don't starve yourself, force yourself to vomit, use laxatives to lose weight, etc. it's very unhealthy and can kill you.\nGood luck, and stay healthy!
Absolutely not! Any state sponsored lottery would never require you to send money to retrieve winnings. It simply is not done. \n\nAsk them kindly to deduct any expenses from your winnings and please forward the balance.

Sheer volume. When a river flows into the sea, it takes time for the waters to mix. While they are mixing, their salt content will vary. Also, various currents exist within the oceans, separated by temperature, which also affect salinity. The whole system is controlled by gravity, wind, and solar energy. Very complex, but also quite interesting. You might want to pick up an oceanography text if the subject interests you.

The United Nations do not keep a standing miltiary force. All the soldiers deployed under the UN flag are put forward by member countries.\n\nTo be on a UN deployment, first of all you must join the military of a member nation. \n\nThen, you have to either volunteer or be selected for UN duty by your chain of command, however high that winds up on going. Only then do you get to wear the sky-blue helmet, beret, ball cap or what have you and be kept under the most stringent rules of engagement you can imagine. \n\nMost deployments are either humanitarian in nature or unarmed observers. High-profile missions like Rwanda are a rarity and no one really wants those. I have afriend who served in Rwanda under Canadian General Romeo Dallaire (upon whom the 'Canadian Colonel' in Hotel Rwanda is based). Like the good General, he came back pretty messed up. \n\nAnd note that UN duty is hard work in very dangerous situations, in which you might not even have a weapon to defend yourself with.

Typing in all caps is the online equivalent to yelling, and therefore bad manners. All caps are also harder to read. Here's why...\n\nOnce we have mastered reading (not sounding out words letter by letter), we recognize words by their shape rather than by the order of the letters. Think about it...you read whole words, not individual letters. When words are typed in all caps, they lose their shape -- that is, they become rectangular. The reader has to revert to reading them one letter at a time, hence slowing them down.\n\nGraphics designers use this as a tool to draw attention by slowing down a reader. It is an effective tool when used properly.
61 bouts\n56 wins\n5 losses\nOnly losses :Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Leon Spinks, Larry Holmes, Trevor Berbick\nThe left jab, combinations, and incredible speed and footwork.\n\nHe had classics with Joe Frazier. His greatest bouts were against Sonny Liston I, George Foreman, and he had good battles with Ken Norton - probably his toughest opponent next to Joe Frazier.\n\nAli was the first heavyweight to regain the title on 3 separate occasions. And for the guy (smalltd28) who said Ali was not the greatest pound-for-pound ever, I respect your opinion, but that's crazy to say that. I'd say 95% of the people you ask will say Ali was the best pound-for-pound. Take away the last two losses late in his career and you'll see that he avenged the other three losses.
I recommend that you read Alice Walker's The Right To Life: What can the white man say to the black woman'. You may know alice walker from the colour purple book.

Cook has lost all four of his past four decisions, and bannister is not worth the risk, especially not having pitched competitively for over 2 months. Also is a bad sign when you have walked more than you have struck out.\n\nAs for replacements, I would get Saito and Shields. This would give you a fourth starter and another reliever.

there are two reason's you are off base. The really physicsy reason is that the second Law of Thermodynamics forbids any 100% efficient engine (in your case, the whole car is the engine). Without going into too much detail, this is because energy is always conserved in the Universe, and any engine loses energy to heat, at least by friction.\n\nThe more understandable reason is this: taking your pinwheel windmill generators as an example, the work that they provide (to charge up the battery) does not come from wind, it comes from the car moving, which comes from the car's engine. Therefore, all the energy going into the battery is extra work the car has to do. \n\nYou can, however, save some energy when you slow down the car, you can return some of its moving energy (kinetic) into a battery.

Given:\na = b = c\n\nEquation:\n2a^2 + b(c*4) = 24\n\nSo:\n2a^2 + a(a*4) = 24\n2a^2 + 4a^2 = 24\n6a^2 = 24\na^2 = 4\nsqrt(a^2) = sqrt(4)\na = sqrt(4)\na = -2 or 2\n\nThe answer is a, b and c are all -2 or 2\n\nTo confirm try it out:\n2(2^2) + 2(2x4) = 24\n2(4) + 2(8) = 24\n8 + 16 = 24 \n24 = 24, \nSo a,b,c = 2 is one answer\n\n2(-2)^2 + -2(-2x4) = 24\n2(4) + -2(-8) = 24\n8 + 16 = 24 \n24 = 24, so a,b,c = -2 is another answer\n\nIt is important to remember that sqrt of 4 is either -2 or 2.

Active forms, which are immediately available to the body are obtained from animal products. These are known as retinoids and include retinal and retinol. Precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body, are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being beta-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in Retinal Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001mg of retinal, or 0.006mg of beta-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A.

Check with the I.R.S. and the Small Business Administration for some free advice.\nYou can deduct business expenses like advertising and travel. Check out Allocation of Income and Expenses, schedule P form 5735 at: http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf. This is the basic form you are looking for.\n\nYou can deduct any equipment that is used exclusively for the business, like a file cabinet, which can be depreciated, usually over seven years, where you recover the expense of the equipment over time. You can also deduct the expenses for your car when used to travel for the business. You must keep a mileage log to qualify. If you use a computer and deduct it then that computer must be devoted entirely to the business, any personal programs on it will cancel this deduction\n\nYou can deduct part of your home expenses for the area of the home that you use exclusively for your business, but this is a red flag for the IRS, and can force an audit. If you want this deduction then make sure that part of the house is used only for business. I knew an Amway dealer that had a system of shelves in the garage for storing his stock. That would be a legal deduction, and you will may need some space to store stock and samples.\n\nYou will need to use the 1040 tax form and remember to pay the self-employment tax (Check out lines 13, 24, 27,28, 29). You will need to fill out Schedule SE Self-Employment Tax (instructions are found at: http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/i1040sse.pdf the form itself is found at: http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf) Use Form 8829 Expenses for Business Use of Your Home.\n\nThese forms are pretty daunting so you might want to find Tax Preparation software, make sure it can handle a small business. Or you might want to go to a Tax Perparer like H&R block. I recommend the later because they will know what deductions are legal and accepted by the I.R.S.
You have to understand that every guy you named has been a slugger since Little League...McGwire and Bonds were jacking out homeruns when they were skinny rookies. Keep in mind, the main reason baseball players used steroids is not for increased power but for the increase in recovery from injuries so they can play more games. Look at the list of guys you put up there who have "used": Bonds, McGwire and Sosa were all home run hitters but were getting older and had more nagging injuries. Why do you think Barry can barely jog to first base these days now that he's not on the juice? Pudge is a catcher, the most physically taxing position in baseball so his use for recovery purposes is understandable.\nARod and Jeter are still reasonably young so they can absorb the punishment. Let's see how they do in 5 or 6 years. Interestingly, how do you think Griffey Jr's homerun total would have been affected if he juiced? The guy was always injured and steroids may have gotten him back on the field quicker.

Yes. Collisions between extra-terrestrial objects and Earth occur all the time. \n\nMost of them are inconsequential (i.e. shooting stars), but every so often one of them is a real doozy.\n\nThe asteroid believed responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs is one such collision. \n\nThere is also evidence that even larger impacts have occurred at various periods. The Manicougan crater in Quebec is a pretty visible reminder of one large impact.\n\nThe craters on the moon show what the Earth might look like if we didn't have erosion and continual vulcanism renewing our surface.\n\nThe moon itself may have been ripped from the mantle of the Earth when a huge asteroid glanced off Earth 3.5 billion years ago.

Well, most people should learn how to handle money, and learn why credit is really voluntary servitude, but they don't teach that in school, either.\n\nAt some point in time, you have to draw a line about what is proper for the school to teach, and what the parents/family have to teach. Basic hygiene, money matters, religion, etc, are all really the responsibility of the parent, not the school. \n\nOur schools do a rotten enough job trying to teach reading, math, and basic sciences. I don't think they can handle anything else.

marshall stacks are very overrated. they haven't done anything to make marshalls better in 40 years. the clean channel sounds dirty and the amps own distortion is muddy. \nthe SG standard is fun guitar to play. depending on your sound..........any fender tube amp will make it sound great. twin reverb is one of the best amps ever built. if you can afford one, get a mesa boogie. a one twelve combo is as loud as any four twelve stack. plus you'd be micking it up anyway on stage. mesa's are so versatile, you can achieve any sounds from them, whether you play country twang or black metal. they are perfect. but you can get that two twelve fender combo for under 800 used. whatever you do, don't buy a solid state amp. even those peavey trans tubes are garbage. i made the mistake of buying one years ago. stick with tubes. especially with those warm hums on the sg. the SG is so thin, you really don't get any resonation from the guitar's wood body. the sound you get is very dependent on your amp with that guitar. it's just strings to pickups to amp. alot of thicker body guitars get a thicker tone because they share some acoustic characteristics. SGs don't get that at all. but what you lose there, you win with the light body, great natural trem, (just shake the guitar around a little bit when you play). and kick butt sound.

Coltan is the colloquial African name for (columbite-tantalite), a metallic ore comprising niobium and tantalum. Mineral concentrates containing tantalum are usually referred to as 'tantalite' [1]. In appearance, coltan is a dull black mineral.\n\n\nProduction and supply\nThe main production of tantalum occurs in Australia [2], where the largest producer, Sons of Gwalia, operates two mines. Tantalum minerals are also mined in Canada, Brazil, China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (80% of the world known reserves). Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of tin mining and smelting.\n\nThe main supply is found in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It is also found and sometimes produced in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Egypt.\n\n\nUse and Demand\nTantalum is used primarily for the production of capacitors, which are vital components in electronic devices, ranging widely from mobile phones to laptop computers. The upsurge in tech products over the past decade has resulted in extraordinary demands and price increases for the mineral [3]. These price increases have contributed to tension in the producing countries, particularly between Congo and Rwanda.\n\n\nProblems\nThe Congo is a politically unstable area and the mining area is also within one of the main ranges of the threatened Eastern Lowland Gorilla.\n\nThe Rwandan occupation in the east of the Congo has meant the DRC has been unable to exploit the resource for its own benefit. A recent UN Security Council report charged that a great deal of the ore is mined illegally and smuggled over the country's eastern borders by militias from neighbouring Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda. Estimates have indicated the Rwandan army profited at least $250 million in as little as 18 months from the sale of Coltan. However, these estimates are problematic as Rwanda possesses its own coltan deposits, making the smuggled mineral difficult to identify.\n\nColtan smuggling has also been implicated as a major source of income for the military occupation of Congo. To many, this raises ethical questions akin to those of conflict diamonds. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate mining operations, several electronics manufacturers have decided to forgo central African Coltan altogether, relying on other sources.\n\nAll three countries named by the United Nations as smugglers of coltan have denied being involved. Austrian journalist Klaus Werner has documented links between multi-national companies and the illegal coltan traffic [1].\n\nIt is also alleged that coltan mining could have severe environmental repercussions on the forests and wildlife in the area, in particular the Gorilla, as noted.\n\n\nPrice increases and changing demands\nThere has been a significant drop in the production and sale of coltan and niobium from African mines since the dramatic price spike in 2000, based on dot com speculation and multiple ordering. This is confirmed in part by figures from the United States Geological Survey [2] [3].\n\nThe Tantalum-Niobium International Study Centre in Belgium (a country with traditionally close links to the Congo), has encouraged international buyers to avoid Congolese coltan on ethical grounds:\n\n"The central African countries of Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda and their neighbours used to be the source of significant tonnages. But civil war, plundering of national parks and exporting of minerals, diamonds and other natural resources to provide funding of militias has caused the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center to call on its members to take care in obtaining their raw materials from lawful sources. Harm, or the threat of harm, to local people, wildlife or the environment is unacceptable."[4] \nHowever, for economic, rather than ethical reasons, a shift is also being seen from traditional sources such as Australia,

It doesn't even sound like an honest mistake.\n\nShe's not a very nice person and isn't giving you the respect you deserve. I would suggest that you tell her how you feel. It may sound aggressive, but your friendship is long gone. So calmly tell her how you don't like that she doesn't help you, and see what her reaction is. If she makes a change, she is a true friend. If she doesn't, hang with nicer people.

when i was eight i used to like to draw cars in particular my own designs i was very proud of one which was a ford Capri body but a sloping nose and a higher back end i called it the ford (i was into cb's at the time) SIERRA. and yes three or four years later ford made a car with the same name and the silhouette was spookily the same. this i swear on my sons life is true i only wish i still had the drawing to prove it. ahh well the real sierra was crap so thank god they didn't blame me LOL.
Assuming you are interested in irons?\n\nReading the answers so far makes me somewhat sad. So many people answer based on marketing hype or just what they hear. First of all, most US golf companies do not manufacture their clubs. They are basically designing and marketing operations and outsource manufacturing to overseas companies. (Ping is an exception to this).\n\nNext, Mizuno is without a doubt the best irons manufacturer. There are only three forging houses in the world that make high quality irons. These are Mizuno, Miura, and Endo. While these all produce top notch products, most industry insiders still give the edge to Mizuno. (US brands that offer forged clubs usually outsource to Endo). Rather than look at what the pro's use, look at what they use after their sponsorship contracts expire.

In the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael More closed it with thie question. He attempted to get members of Congress to send their children to serve in Iraq as a way of pointing out the class divide between the United States' leaders and the people who serve in the military. Moore did acknowledge that at the start of the war in Iraq, there appears to have been only one member of Congress with a child serving in Iraq: Sen. Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota), whose son Brooks serves in the Army.\n\nTwo more Congressmen had sons who reportedly were being sent to Iraq in late 2003 or early 2004: Representatives Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) and Duncan Hunter (R-California).\n\nIn addition, there are some other members of Congress and the Bush administration with children or relatives serving in the military if not necessarily in Iraq. For example, Representative Mark Kennedy (R-Minnesota), who was seen in Fahrenheit 9/11, reportedly has a nephew serving in Afghanistan, and one of his four children reportedly was thinking of joining the navy. Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andrew also reportedly has served in the Navy in the Persian Gulf.
Relative humidity is the moisture content of air relative to the temperature. Warmer air can hold more moisture (measured in grains) than cold air. If you have 70 degree air at 90 percent humidity and the temperature suddenly dropped to 50 degrees, the humidity level would rise to 100 percent. This is called the saturation or dew point. when the humidity is at 100 percent the air can hold no more moisture and it begins to condensate (fog, dew, rain) until the relative humidity drops below 100 percent. When you wake up and it is foggy (air is at dewpoint) and in a while the sun warms the air and the fog clears, this is an example of a drop in relative humidity.

I feel for you, although I do not work nights my mom is a nurse that works the exact shift you do. She has trouble with sleep and working it around a semi-normal excercise and eating schedule. But she does it just like you would do it the other way, she eats several small meals at night and doesn't eat during the day, she sleeps then. Gets up before work has dinner (or breakfast I guess to her) then excercises (or vice versa) and gets ready for work. She does it the exact way she would do it if she worked the day shift.

Hey do you mean Ayurveda?\n\nAyurveda (आयुर्वेद Sanskrit: ayu—life; veda—knowledge of) or ayurvedic medicine is a more than 2,000 year old comprehensive system of medicine based on a holistic approach rooted in Vedic culture. Its conspicuous use of the word veda, or knowledge, reveals its role in early Hinduism and describes its hallowed place in India. Ayurveda also had a tradition of surgery. Two early texts of Ayurveda are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita.\n\nThe Charaka and Sushruta Samhitās are compendiums of two traditions rather than texts authored by single authors. A third tradition is that of the Kāshyapas. The scholarly traditions of ayurveda date back to the time of the Buddha, who died (mahaparinirvana) in approximately 400 BCE. Some plant remedies of ayurveda are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature 2nd millennium BC, but the formal doctrines of the three humours and other key ayurvedic ideas are first mentioned in the Buddhist Canonical literature. Both the Sushruta and Charaka Samhitās are the product of several editorial hands, having been revised and supplemented over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe scholar Vāgbhata, who lived in Sind at the beginning of the 7th century AD, produced a grand synthesis of earlier ayurvedic materials in a verse work called Ashtānga Samhita. Another work associated with the same author, the Asthanga Samgraha, contains much the same material in a more diffuse form, written in a mixture of prose and verse. The relationship between these two works, and a third intermediate compilation, is still a topic of active research. The works of Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata are considered canonical and reverentially called the Vriddha Trayi, "the triad of ancients"; or Brhat Trayi, "the greater triad." In the early eighth century, Mādhav wrote his Nidāna, a work on etiology, which soon assumed a position of authority. In the 79 chapters of this book, he lists diseases along with their causes, symptoms, and complications.\n\nThe vast majority of Ayurvedic therapies are herbal compounds. Some alchemical preparations start to enter the ayurvedic pharmacopieia towards the end of the 1st millennium AD in works such as those of Ugraditya (8th century AD)and Sarngadhara (14th century AD). It also provides therapies for the treatment of various vegetable and animal toxins like scorpion, spider and snake venom. It has a whole science of toxicology called agada-tantra as one of the eight branches of traditional Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic idea is that the organism adapts to the environment and its food, climate etc. This principle of adaptation is called satyma. Through introducing small amounts of a food or medicine, the organism can adapt to it and learn to resist it.\n\nAyurveda became increasingly symptom-based, treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the root cause. However, it is important to note that Ayurveda was originally a consciousness based system of health care. Its philosophy, expressed in modern terms, is to strengthen the immune system.\n\n\nQualities\nIt could be said that the simple essence of ayurveda is knowledge and awareness of the qualities of nature – called gurvadi gunah. By understanding the qualities inherent in the environment, in foodstuffs, in activities, etc., one gains an appreciation of their effects on the individual constitution through the principle of similarities; i.e., that similarities cause increase while dissimilarities cause decrease. Thus hot qualities in the environment or diet will increase hot qualities in the body.\n\nThe gurvadi gunah are listed in Vagbhata's Ashtanga Hrdayam as:\n\nGuru (heavy) – laghu (light) \nManda (slow) – tikshna (quick, sharp) \nHima (cold) – ushna (hot) \nSnigdha (unctuous) – ruksha (dry) \nSlakshna (smooth) – khara (rough) \nSandra (solid) – drava (liquid) \nMrdu (soft) – kathina (hard) \nSthira (stable) – cala (mobile) \nSuk

Well thats really several questions. Any fab shop with laser or plasma cutting equipment and some machine shop capablility can fabricate a centrifugal blower wheel. We've build several using stainless steel. But not with Air foil blades, which are only good for clean air, if any dust or dirt is in the air stream I'd recommend flat rather than air foil blades.\n\nAs for the second part, theres never been a time when it was easier to produce a high quality product without a lot of expensive tooling. Advances in computer aided design and CNC machining have made it possible to produce precision parts in small quantities. \n\nThe company where I work produces one of kind special machines and what components we can't buy off the shelf we can fabricate for in most cases ourselves. But I could farm out all of the welding and machine work and only bolt the assemblies together will nothing but hand tools.\n\nOne of our competitors in Florida builds food processing equipment. He farms out all of the components which require machining or welding. He assembles his equipment with a wrench. To do that would require accurate component drawings and proper tolerances. Which if you have a good CAD system shouldn't be a problem.

No, the verse is not wrong. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness".\nMany individuals I've seen answering/asking questions are completely anti-God/anti-Christian, and therefore will answer negatively to any question about scripture.\nThe more appropriate question is, "Why do those that only seek to mock the faith of others bother visiting the Religion & Spirituality section?".

Faith, as it is found in Christianity, is a cop out to really trying to understand the nature of the universe. In Buddhism, the monks tell you not to take anything without evidence. Why? Because they are seeking the truth. And, you do not find the truth by following things without evidence. Spirituality, is developed when you discover a little more about the nature of our relationship to the infinite.

you like the bad-for-you stuff because back in the hunter-gatherer days storing fat was very desirable. you didn't know where your next meal was coming from. it's a reward pathway built into the brain.\n\nnow food is easily accessible and we don't have to worry about it, but high-energy-content foods like fats and sugars are still very desirable from the body's standpoint because it's always looking to store up for the future.

I'm not sure that it's more widely accepted, but the supply has increased exponentially.

"A certain amount of free fluid in the pelvis, behind the uterus, is normal at certain points in your cycle; after ovulation, a small amount of fluid released with the egg collects behind the uterus and is eventually reabsorbed by the body. A larger amount of fluid may indicate a ruptured ovarian cyst. Pain is usually present in this instance, but most often resolves on its own within a few days. Infection is another possibility, but in this case symptoms such as pain and fever are often significant."\n\nPerhaps you should get a second opinion.

Good question.\nReligions are only different ways to become closer to the creator. Some people need more commands and religious ceremonies to reach higher level of virtue and purification; others need only few commands to become purify and a good person.\nReligions should regarded as intermediary means , religions themselves are not the goal.\nreligions can educate people to live in peace and harmony, to love people and control our "natural vicious behavior" and being virtuous.\nAll these can be achieved only if we don't judge other people and don't try to convert them to any religion. If each one does all his efforts to educate himself and try to become a better person, then we all Will become better people.

I think that there are relatively few criticisms for buddhism because it is such a relaxed religion...Buddhism is much less strict than Christianity or Islam, for example. The riles that believers must follow are less intense, and Buddhists really do not judge people of different faiths.
I have about $10,000 but it's in a no-interest credit card, at least for 12 months. I'm using it to balance out an investment that will pay 15% after a year, so in the end I'll make about $1500 on the deal.\n\nWish I could do that with a million dollars -- wouldn't have to work at all. :)\n\nAnyway I have equity in my house to cover the loan if anything should go wrong, so it's not exactly the same as what you mean. My overall net worth is well into the black.\n\nThere was a time when my wife (now ex-wife, long story) and I had together over $30,000 in credit card loans but we managed to get a low-interest loan to cover the entire amount and paid it off in about 2-3 years, after we got good jobs. But things were pretty scary there for a bit.

Depends entirely on your state.\n\nFor example, Florida does not have a state income tax, so they charge heavy taxes on mortgage loans. \n\nFees are broken down into many parts, and without listing what the fees are going to, it is not fair to make a judgment call on your fees. If, for example, $3,000 is going to state taxes, then this loan is not very expensive at all. If, however, $3,000 is going to the broker as "origination", "points" or the like, then it MIGHT be an expensive loan.\n\nIn Ohio, you would expect to pay about $2,300 in the basic, non-broker, related costs. This includes title, pre-paids, taxes, and insurance escrows. This would mean about $2,100 to the broker.\n\nIn the scheme of things, $2,100 is not a lot of money to pay a broker - depending on whether they are also getting paid on the interest rate. Look for a little number somewhere on your "Settlement Statement" called "YSP" or "Premium" or Yeild Spread Premium. The number next to this (not added in the big column) is the amount the broker is getting from the bank outside of closing for arranging this loan. \n\nIn our example, if this amount was about $1,000, I would say this broker was fairly paid. Some might disagree with me, but about $3,300 in broker income is average for the industry. If it is over this, you'll need to consider what you are comfortable paying.\n\nIf you are within 3 days of the loan closing, you have the right to "rescind" the transaction by following the directions on the rescion paperwork. Follow them closely, as you likely have to fax the paperwork to the lender - not your broker.\n\nIf it is after 3 days, you'll be happy to know you are better informed today than you were then. You likley will have no recourse.\n\nSee a lawyer if you feel really screwed, but don't rely on the end cost to make your decision. You can pay off a 30 year mortgage about 6 years early by simply making an extra payment each year.\n\nFinally, if your credit is bad, you should expect to pay more. It's not that you are getting screwed, it's just people are taking a bigger risk lending you money.\n\nBest of Luck.

Hero Steve Biko 1946 -1977\n\nBantu Steven Biko was born on 18 December 1946 in Ginsberg, a township outside King William's Town (near East London, South Africa). Thirty years later, he was dead after being severely beaten while in police custody. Biko, best known of the leaders of the Black Consciousness Movement, is regarded as one of the greatest martyrs of the anti-apartheid struggle.\n\nWhat he said:\n\n"We have set on a quest for true humanity, and somewhere on the distant horizon we can see the glittering prize. Let us march forth with courage and determination, drawing strength from our common plight and brotherhood. In time we shall be in a position to bestow upon South Africa the greatest gift possible - a more human face". Steve Biko, Black Consciousness - A quest for a true humanity.

Suicide is a great sin in Islam and "suicide bombers" are not in any way real muslims, they are only muslim by name. I don't know where they got the impression that killing themselves would take them to heaven because that is SO untrue. The word "jihad" has nothing to do with holy war. It basicaly means to fight for your rights as a muslim. Example, many muslim women are experiencing difficulty wearing the veil these days, so for a woman to go out wearing the veil anyways in like "jihad." She is strong in her beliefs and is doing something that in no way harms anyone else. I hope this helps.

Salmonella typhi is similar to other salmonellae in that it is a gram-negative, flagellate, nonencapsulated, nonsporulating, facultative anaerobic bacillus that ferments glucose, reduces nitrate to nitrite, and synthesizes peritrichous flagella when motile. \n\nBeing such, you can use chloramphenicol, ampicillin (or any penicillin), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin (or any quinolone), a 3rd generation cephalosporin, or azithromycin.

I think you mean "the Balkans," not balkan.\n\nHere is a little background on the start of World War I:\n\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. He was murdered at Sarajevo, the capital of the Austrian province of Bosnia. The assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian-trained Bosnian terrorist. Austria claimed that Serbian government officials had trained and equipped Princip's group, which was known as the Black Hand. For many years Serbia and Austria-Hungary had been unfriendly because Serbian nationalists wanted to unite all Slavic peoples living in the Balkan region into a single state. Slavs living in Austria-Hungary would be included, and Austria-Hungary strongly opposed this.\n\nSo, as you can see, the Balkan region is where the tensions of the Bosnians and Serbs ignited the war. They called upon their allies and World War I began.
Trigylcerides are composed of two types of molecules: glycerol and 3 fatty acids.\n\nPhospholipids are similar to triglycerides in that they contain glycerol and fatty acids, too. But, the big difference is that phospholipids are made up of 1 glycerol molecule and only 2 fatty acid molecules (not 3!)\n\nThis is a big difference because in place of the third fatty acid, phospholipids have a polar group attached to the glycerol molecule. Remember, triglycerides were entirely hydrophobic because all three positions on the glycerol molecule were taken up by nonpolar fatty acids. But, phospholipids have a polar group in one place on the glycerol molecule, making phospholipids partly hydrophilic; the polar group helps to form the polar head. The two fatty acids, maintain a hydrophobic portion of the phospholipid, the tails.

Nothing... we learn from our history so we don't repeat it.. at some point in your history you have to make mistakes... we've made a lot of bad decisions, and we have learned from them and grown as a country-without those mistakes, where would we be today as a country.. what would we have learned from... you can only learn from what you have done and not repeat it...Making mistakes makes you a better person and country
You talk about female empowerment but abortion is anything but. I'm sorry but my opinion is that women who use abortion as a type of birth control need to grow up and be smart. I could see the reason for ROE vs. Wade when that was passed although personally I don't agree. But in this day and age of all the many types of birth control out there why do women think they have the right to end a life because they were lazy or just didn't want to make the effort. We have taught the future generation in so many ways that there is no recoarse for stupid choices. The answer cold blooded murder. Now don't get me wrong, abortion in cases of rape and incest, or serious danger to the mothers health needs to be considered and I feel would fall under acceptable reasons for allowing abortion, but come on give me a break as far as It's my choice and right even if I'm a lazy immorale piece of crap who has a bazillion types of ways to not get pregnant and doesn't use one of them. I'm sorry I think that puts women and their liberated ways back 100 years. Also how many women do you really know who actually perform abortions. The majority of them are men! Get a clue ladies.\nI'm just tired of the way people are so casual about it and especially when it doesn't have to happen if you're so smart. I am for pro Choice.......... condoms, IUD's, the shot, the pill, the patch, foam, cream, norplant, the day after, what ever you choose, just not abortion.\n\nI just want to add it is not a great thing, I know someone who chose that road and it almost did her in. It took many years for her to recover from it mentally, and all those pro choicers why don't you ask them how many have actually gone through the proceedure. Plain and simple fact is it is demoralizing and mentally destroying. It is not what they make it out to be is the whole problem. And for young girls it really isn't the answer. Not with out making sure she knows exactly what it is she's doing and there are too many people out there with their own agendas who don't care about the individual or what it really does to a person. That's probably the biggest problem I have with the whole situation. Why not spend some of the money of education of these young girls and teach them safe sex times2, less spread of diseases and less chance of pregnancy when you use a condom. Prevent unwanted preg. that way. Not deal with them after the fact.

A chromosome mutation is a change that involves a part of, or an entire chromosome: examples: non-homologous translocations,\nadditions or deletions caused by chromosomal breakage and reattachment, inversions, nondisjunction, polyploidy, to name a few .\n\nA gene mutation involves a change in DNA, like mis- pairing of the N-bases .This is considered a biochemical change.\n\nThere are specific genetic disorders in humans associated with either chromosome or gene mutations.
Swelling occurs when ligaments are injured because the ligaments are intimately connected with the functioning of the joints. Ligaments hold our joints together, helping to maintain the structural integrity of the skeletal system. When a ligament is strained, the synovial membrane of the joint where the ligament is located is "told" by the brain to produce more fluid than is required for proper functioning. This increase in synovial fluid causes the joint to swell. This swelling is our body's way of sending us a strong and important message. The body is saying, "Don't move me too quickly or too vigorously, or I will send pain signals to remind you that I need to rest in order to heal."

Cool Idea! This really shows that you "Think Different[ly]"! Okay, i'm not a genious here, but here are some thoughts...\n\nApple Qmaster (part of Final Cut Studio) allows you to distribute batches from Compressor to compress on different machines. This would come in handy during compression, but as far as processing on a regular basis, it would be a waste. Apple ran a story about a college with a whole roomfull of G5's, making a whatever teraflop supercomputer. I think they just used Ethernet, but they may have installed something else in a PCI card slot, which wouldn't be possible on a Mini.\n\nAdvantages....Multiple Hard Drives, USB ports out the wazoo, ability to separate(LAN party anyone?) and a cool looking "Chick Magnet"\n\nDisadvantages...Heat. If you're planning on getting the Intel mini's especially, heat will be an issue. You'll probably want to install a fan in your enclosure.\n\nThat sounds like a cool idea, and you'll have to put pics on the web if you get one built.
It is an aircraft with modified swivel wings that does not require the aircraft to have a long runway for take off. Instead it raises the turbine wings and rises in a vertical manner from where it was parked, when aloft the wings will readjust to an angle and thus the aircraft will be flown in a forward motion. It is usually used by the military for operations in areas withour adequate landing space.

Because you are dealing with products not regulated by the FDA (diet pills) the safety and potency should always be questioned.\n\nDiet pills do work, although not forever. You see, diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while. \n\nThey do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.\n\nThere are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first. \n\n1. Genetics - you have very little control, but you are not a prisoner of your genes. \n\n2. Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think, oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder. Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs, bones, fluids and fat. You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly, resistance exercise, and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites (smoking, heavy drinking and drug use)\n\n3. Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.\n\n4. Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.\nMost people are dehydrated and they dont know it.\n\n5. Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.\n\nYou will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

RRJ for sure. Some may say they see the Golden Boy - Oscar DelaHoya, Maybe even Tito, all of which would be valid as well.\n\nI did forget E. Holyfield. Holyfield was a great boxer, and he did fight and beat the best, almost every time he was challenged, he never had the aura or "that special something" that makes people watch him or makes people listen to him. RRJ is a great boxer and a showman. Delahoya as well. That's the difference. Mike Tyson was not a successful boxer in the 90's. He is the great boxer of the 80s -not the 90s.

Interesting question.\n\nSure there would have been far less wars, but then again both world wars had nothing to do with religion.\nThere wouldn't have been any witch burnings, but people would still have been hung, or tortured or killed for stealing to survive or for looking at a monarch the wrong way. \nSure you wouldn't have people knocking at your door hoping to shove the bible or whatever down your throats. Instead you'd probably get some scientist trying to verify his theory about where the world came from, and how we really are floating on the back of a giant turtle!\nThere would be less murder, but would there be less compassion?\nLess rasicsm? Not by much. \n\nThe annoying thing about religion is, we need it. There are those amognst us who don't, but the majority do. Without it people wouldn't live as long, wouldn't be as happy, life would have no purpose, no meaning, those who seek the easy answer would never find it. \n\nThe idea of God is a great one, and his main message is pretty good too. The only problem is all the other shit that gets mixed up with it, people are human, and humans are corrupt, therefore there will always be those who will use religion as a way of controling, or surpressing, or going to war. \n\nBut people have survived thanks to religion, if you ask the question would there be anarchy and sin ruling the world without religoin, my answer would be slightly different...But you didn't ask that, so...In answer to this question. No I don't think the world would be a better place without religion. But I don't think it would be choas. It would just be slightly worse.

Studying is a big part of being a top performer, but it's not enough. You need to have the desire to learn! For me, the easiest way to build this desire is to try to mentally apply all lessons to something in life outside of school. This worked for me with everything except algebra. For years I would ask "why do I need to know this?" I never got any good answers until I was out of school for 9 years. The answer was quite simple ... Algebra teaches you to think! I really wish I knew this when I was in school. I barely passed with a D in high school, and had to take Algebra 098 in college to get into other math.\n\nWhen you have a desire to learn, studying doesn't really exist. You are on a quest for knowledge. You'll often need to find more resources to fulfill your need to know. It's a wonderful adventure, continuing your whole life, not ending when the last bell sounds in your senior year.\n\nGood luck, I hope you can build this desire!
It was very sad that many innocent victims died in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but it prevented the U.S from having to invade the Japanese mainland at the cost of millions of Americans lives. A survey was taken but the U.S government and they estimated that over a million U.S servicemen would be killed in the attacks on japans mainland. Plus the countless number of Japanese civilian and Japanese military casualties that would be in result of an attack. The attacks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki together only resulted in around 214,000 casualties. In terms of life lost the invasion of the Japanese mainland would have been much worse than the attacks of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Also there is strong evidence that the Japanese had worked on atomic bombs themselves and they could have eventually used them on us. Some of the people who have responded to this question are absolute idiots and are clearly misinformed of the events that took place in WW2.

Occlusion is a term indicating that the state of something, which is normally open, is now totally closed.\n\nIn medicine, the term is often used to refer to blood vessels, arteries or veins which have become totally blocked to any blood flow. For issues of artery occlusion, see stenosis, atheroma, and coronary catheterization.\n\nIn dentistry, the term is used to refer to the manner in which the teeth from upper and lower arches come together when the mouth is closed.\n\nIn computer graphics and image processing, occlusion is the effect of one object in space blocking another object from view.
I have seen twelve people serve in this capacity, eleven of whom were elected, one appointed. That was Gerald Ford. Six of these individuals were democrats, and six were republican. Seven were president during a wartime situation, five were not. Four of our wartime presidents were democrats and three were republicans. A few skirmishes that ocurred, such as 'the bay of pigs', the 'Ghana rescue mission', are not identified here as wartime situations. It is difficult to rate these men in order of effectiveness except to say that Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands out as an accomplish leader. He brought this nation out of a depression, he was in office when social security began, and he guided this nation through WWII. He showed courage and leadership when others cowered, and he did all this from a wheelchair.

Hm...I wonder why they think that. She should ask them. She could show them pictures of other female skateboarders from magazines or videos. Talking to them is really the best thing to find out what is really going on. Maybe they are worried she will break an arm or something. Maybe they are worried since it is mostly a male sport and they don't wnat her to be around all those guys. If skateboarding is what she loves to do then I say go for it girl...be different from all the other girls...change the perception and have fun!!!!

Go ahead and try experiencing these things you crave. There is nothing morally wrong about naturism, the enjoyment of our God-given bodies in the natural environment can indeed be a spiritual experinece. If you don't try these experiences, you will always feel you are missing out and deprived. You need to be brave and throw off your background inhibitions. You can always stop if you find the experience doesn't match up to the expectation. But, it is the things that we lack the courage to try that we regret, not trying things and deciding from a position of knowledge that we don't like them.\nI had a similar dilemma to you (still working on it actually) but where I have confronted it and accepted my desires and embraced them I am much happier. You can contact me directly if you want to discuss it further.

Freemasonry is a large and diverse group of human beings. I cannot not speak for all or even most of them. I will speak only for what I have experienced.\n\nFreemasonry is not a religion. In our Order, we say it is a kind of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols. \n\nWe stress the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you). There are many other rules of conduct that we find work in the betterment of oneself and the world. Some of those expressions have come into wide use in English: someone who "levels" with you, treats you "square," etc.\n\nWe speak about moral lessons in story form. I am sure you know things like "the little boy who cried wolf" (that is an example of allegory, a story with a moral). \n\nWe use the tools of operative masons (those who build real buildings) as symbols, as objects for contemplation and study. When we teach by symbols, we learn much about the inside of the person asking about them as well as those hearing the response. \n\nFor some Freemasons, the organization is strictly fraternal and devoted to good works. That in itself is a wonderful thing. The Shriners (an offshoot of the Freemasons) have hospitals that treat children with burns and disabilities free of charge.\n\nFor some Freemasons, Freemasonry is the heir to the Ancient Mystery schools. It is a way of achieving what some have termed enlightenment. As far as I know, Freemasonry works to make good people better. \n\nWe do, at least in my Order of Freemasonry (American Co-Masonry) insist that the candidate for admission must believe in a Supreme Being. We do not press them further about that belief. We thus admit Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. We insist also that the person is of good character already, not an anarchist, and is of age (usually 21). \n\nWhere American Co-Masonry differs from those others calling themselves Freemasons (or "real" Freemasons) is that we admit women to full membership, rights, and privileges. We admit all races, also.\n\nIf you wish more information, feel free to write to me and click on the link below to read more on our history.
first of all 5'5" isnt even short thats probly average for an adult female. like a few others said it could be done surgically but i seriously doubt a doc would do it for a girl thats 5'5". they break the leg bones and use braces to spread them apart (like i'm gonna do with ur legs :D ). the bones naturally try to grow back towards each other to try to heal, which lengthens the bone, and the braces are very gradually adjusted to pull the bones further apart to add more height. just wear some big a** stripper shoes, hehe get some clear heels.\nand u cant f*ck him unless u f*ck me first ;)\n\n&#92;/

A hardware interface which is faster than IDE, allows more memory, and can connect up to four devices (such as hard drives, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives) to the computer.\n\n\n\nEnhanced integrated drive electronics (EIDE) hard drives have been the standard in the home computer industry for more than 10 years. Some newer computer system motherboards don’t have EIDE ports, but a PCI EIDE controller card can be installed to add support for EIDE drives. If you don’t know whether your computer has EIDE ports on the motherboard, refer to your computer or motherboard documentation or contact the motherboard manufacturer.

The intrinsically brightest star known is S Doradus, a star in one of the Magellanic Clouds. It is so far away that it can only be seen with a telescope, and in fact probably no longer exists, since its distance of 180,000 light years exceeds its estimated life expectancy of 160,000 years. However, you would have needed to be 0.11 lightyear from it to have the same insolation as the Earth gets from the Sun. Of course, a larger percentage from S Dor would be in the form of ultraviolet, enough to kill in a few hours. Not recommended for tourist visits by the Galactic Chamber of Commerce.
It does, although it is pretty weak. The magnetic field depends on the rotation of the planet's metal core. That's what creates the field. \n\nThe other planets with magnetic fields include: Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nIf a planet doesn't have a rotating core of metal, it will not have a magnetic field, such as Pluto.

Wow, 150% of her pens are red. You should note that Claire has more red pens than total pens, which makes no sense at all. If you meant she has 4 red pens out of 6 pens total, then here you go:\n\n(4 red pens)/(6 pens total) = .6666666\n.6666666 x 100% = 66.666% (two thirds of her pens are red)\n\nIf you meant she has 6 red pens and 4 non-red pens, then this is what you want:\n\n(6 red pens)/(10 pens total) = .6\n.6 x 100% = 60% (three fifths of her pens are red)

Okay, this is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM).If the velocity is zero after 0.5s, this means the period of oscillation (T) is 2x0.5s = 1.0sec. If the initial displacement is 0.1m, then the amplitude of oscillation (A) is 2x0.1m = 0.2m. The maximum speed of the object will be achieved when the displacement is 0. The equation for the displacement for SHM is:\n\ny = Asin(2pift + pi/2) where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency = 1/T and disp = initial displacement, and t = time.\n\nSo the velocity is given by the time derivative of displacement:\n\nv = Acos(2pift + pi/2) = 0.2cos(2pit + pi/2)\n\nNow, since the maximum velocity is achieved after 0.25s (the max velocity is when the object passes through the origin which will be after half the time taken to reach the other end of the cycle);\n\nv = 0.2cos(pi/2 + pi/2) = 0.2cos pi = -0.2m/s\n\nqed

assume we are dealing with\nvehicle gasoline\n1 m^3 =737.22 kg\n1000 kg= 1/0.73722 m^3\n{1000kg fresh water=1000m^3}\nassume barrel =40 gallons\n=40*4.545963 litres\n{1m^2=1000litres}\n\ntherefore,\n1000kg\n=10^3/(0.7322*40*4.545963)\n=7.510768695 barrels \n\ntherefore, 1 tonne of vehicle gasoline\nis approximately 7.5 barrels\n\ni hope that this helps
Neither...and both. He was a man of his time. Many believe he saved the Union, at the expense of the Republic and started what is known as the "imperial presidency".\n\nOh, and for the record, the Emancipation Proclamation didn't "free the slaves"...if you read the text, it only freed the slaves that were in the states in rebellion. Slavery was still legal in Maryland and other jurisdictions in the Union where it wasn't prohibited. It took an ammendment passed in Grant's administration to fully abolish slavery in the US. By today's standards, Lincoln and most of his generals and cabinet would be considered racists. Again...he was a man of his time.

High Cascade Snowboard Camp V Windell's, the rivalry of the ages. Well, personally I am a fan of MHSSC, Mount Hood Summer Ski Camp, however my friend, who competed in Oregon at the Paul Mitchell Progression Session and took first place in the nation, Tim Humphrey's has told me that both the on hill and off hill training at Windell's is far superior to that of HCSC. I would have to say that being biased towards neither of those, I would have to say also that Windells has a far better name, and the coaching staff is much more renown than that of HCSC. If you want to look into another camp though, MHSSC is the way to go man!
Null means nothing. So if you nullify a law, you make it nothing. If the Supreme Court rules that a law is unconstitutional, they nullify it.

Here is your detailed synopsis:\n\nKyle Pratt is a frantic but fiercely intelligent mother whose deepest protective instincts will be triggered by a haunting in-flight nightmare: in the middle of the trans-Atlantic trip, her young daughter turns up missing without a trace. Or does she? Kyle arrives on the flight still reeling from the recent loss of her husband, a woman who has gone mad with grief or a formidably determined mother whose child is in grave danger that threatens the entire plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\n\nStarring: Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby

First things first, don't be dieting unless you are obese. If you're just overweight, it is a very bad time in your life to be doing that to your growing body.\n\nSecond, since you're 14, you're probably a freshman. I have to say, you really don't need to be going out with guys right now. Not only is it just too young, but guys are really not finding themselves yet, and until guys find themselves, they won't be able to see the beautiful, true you. I hate how it works, but I also strongly dislike shallow people and avoid them.\n\nSo basically, it is unlikely that there are many guys your age who can actually see behind the mask, which I know is a travesty but it's just what media does to us.\n\nPlus, having a boyfriend at this age, although is scattered with good times, is wrought with bad times and hurt feelings. Just wait for a little while, and when the right guy comes along you'll know.\n\nBest of luck to you!
1. In a democracy, the people rule. The people get to decide who their leaders are and how they want to be represented. In that sense, the people have a say in the way government runs. The laws and policies are the will of the people.\n\n2. In a democracy, the rulers must answer to the people. Not only are they elected by the people, but they must not overstep their bounds. This means that power is checked so that no one leader can become too powerful. In America, Presidents can only run for office twice, and they are liable to impeachment if they overstep their authority and commit "high crimes and misdemeanors". Most public officials in our American democracy understand that their powers are limited and the transition from one President to another is smooth and without violence. By contrast, in some countries where democracy is much more limited, the leaders use corrupt means to stay in power, and violence often erupts when a leader refuses to step down.

I so can't believe no one answered this question! Ok here goes......\n\n (Ok now am I allowed to have fun with it or do I have to attack it seriously? Ok....we'll see what comes out)\n\nA sociopath obviously will have anti social behavior. For what reasons? Numerous! But a sociopath many times withdraws from society because of hating themselves. Ok something in society could have brought them to this conclusion, but many have been known to be so unhappy with who they are that they remove themselves from any and all social relationships and contact.\n\nNarcissists on the other hand (ok say that three times fast)have an abundance of self adoration! However, they become so preoccupied and fixated upon themselves that they develop a lack of awareness of others. They lack empathy toward others as they fall out of sync with societal gestures of kindness and generosity and sincere concern. However, I don't believe they become anti-social. They have a need to point out to others their fine attributes. It is not enough to love thyself........they must make sure others accept them in the same way. Perhaps society shuns them for this just enough to make them feel the need to love themselves in a way no one else seems to. \n\nNow as I said in the beginning.......there are NUMEROUS reasons we fall into the categories of sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors. All cases are different. So my answer is...........No...not always. (and oftentimes not)\n\nOk......when I started off I was so going to make this funny. But as I started thinking about it, I honestly grabbed hold of a depth in the question that I hadn't felt before. Thanks for making me think about it.

Alot of it has to do with the shorthand used for text messages and IMing. Because of the rapidness of the conversation a generally accepted form of shorthand developed to increase the rate of conversation. If you could look at the people who demonstrate these forms of bad grammar on message boards like this one, I would be willing to bet they are high school/early college aged who grew up conversing on the computer. To them the commonly accepted rules of syntax are loosened for convience. Therefore they are following a commonly agreed upon set of rules, which in a way make this a unique language while derived from english, follow different rules. Check out the source for examples.

This Constitutional Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18) is also referred to as the sweepings clause. “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested in the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”\n\nThe Constitutional Convention had a great deal of debate concerning the meaning and need for this clause. In short the initial meaning of this clause was that the congress had the power to enact what was required to enforce its delegated powers, that is, the new laws would be necessary to enforce powers which had been properly delegated to the federal government. \n\nFrom 1801 to 1835 the Supreme Court of the United States fell under the sway of Chief Justice John Marshall who believe in a very strong general government as did Alexander Hamilton. Marshall opined (in part) in McCulloch v. Maryland [1819] that the words of Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 “Necessary” and “Proper” had the same meaning. Therefore laying the foundation for the Congress to enact any law they believed to be necessary. Both Madison and Jefferson disagreed with this court decision, but it has stood as precedence for ensuing cases to use it to strengthen the position of the federal government. From this perspective the “Elastic” was stretched out of all shape relative to original intent.
Oh Geeez...\n\nOk here's one..\n\nTwo men went to mechanics school to learn how to put a car engine back together from all the parts.\n\nThe final exam was upon them which was to actually assemble the engine. The person that made the highest score had a position waiting for them with a well respected car manufacturing plant where they would be on a team to design new systems for the future.\n\nThe first guy was into engineering before this course the second was a former gynocologist, so naturally the gyno was nervous about passing the final exam.\n\nThe engineer was able to put his car together in record time, while the former gynocologist took twice the time to put his car together.\n\nThe instructor gave the highest score to the gynocologist, and the engineer was baffled, and upset.. then he questioned the instructor on the fairness of his grades.\n\nThe instructor said "It's true you both assembled so the engine ran perfectly, I gave each of you credit of 100% for being able to accomplish that.. but I gave an additional 100 points to the other guy because he did all the assembly through the tail pipe."

A copper calorimeter is a small solid block of pure copper in a vacuum that has thermocouple wires attached to it to measure the rise in temperature of the block with exposure of the block to controlled amounts of energy from a heat source. Thermal loss must be minimized, readings must be immediate, calibrations must be highly accurate, temperature variations within the block must be eliminated (hence the need for a small block).

Talk about stupid questions...\n\nanyway, no, Dumblebore is dead and he will stay that way. Harry can communicate with him though, using the portrait that appeared after his death.\n\nIt's more likely that Snape is indeed loyal to the order of the Phoenix and that him killing Dumbledore was something that he and Dumbledore set up together (remember their fight in book 6, the one that Harry overheard?) knowing full well that this would ensure that \na) Voldermort would finally take a chance to actually kill Harry, something he wouldn't do as long as Dumbledore was still alive\nand\nb) Voldemort really believes that Snape is a loyal deatheater, thus making sure that Voldemort doesn't expect Snape to kil him. Which will of course happen, probably helped by Harry. And probably Snape is going to die in this attempt.

You have to start where the ban was initiated. If it was your direct teacher, start with them. Was the ban placed on just you? If this was a school-wide ban enacted because of your actions it's going to be more difficult to get turned over. \n\nIn the case that it is a school-wide rule, you need to submit a letter to the principal requesting a meeting and stating your reasons why you feel the ban is not necessary. You cannot be overly aggressive, as this person will probably be your only chance. Going above the principal will create problems for you down the road.\n\nAfter meeting with the principal, if you feel that you still have not made any headway, your next step will be to form a petition. Start a sheet with a typed heading stating, in very clear, concise terms, what it is that you are trying to get accomplished. Get as many signatures as you can and present this to your principal. This will show how many are as interested as you in getting the ban lifted. \n\nBeyond this, attending a school board meeting might work, but if you get rejected there...your fight will be much more difficult.\n\nBest of luck to you!

How long have you been in the business, personally I think going back to work for someone after self employment and being your own Boss, is a step backwards. If the business is not producing what you expected, then you need to examine the reasons for this rather than throw in the towel and go and work for a fixed income employer, whom will govern your whole life and time and basically everything you do until you retire. \n\nYou must have been pretty unhappy to have bought the business in the first place and quit your last job, so why return to the same street you left ? Look at that business and all thats wrong with it and put those things right first. If it was all a big mistake and you are really not at all cut out for business ownership, then do return to being an employee! Good luck.

soo many pros and cons to this. First, some surveys pay high, but what is high? do you consider $15 dollars a high pay for doing nothing but sitting on your butt? maybe....so, what do you have to do for 15 dollars? maybe answer a survey that takes like 3 hours.....see how they get you? or sometimes you have to qualify for the survey...so they ask you qualifying questions first...and if you qualify, they give you the survey..if not then forget it.....and it costed you time to look and then you dont get it alot of times...reason is because they need a certain "strain" of people to get an exact opinion to complete their requirement sensitive surveys....and sometimes they dont pay you right away...and other times you need to get at least 20 dollars before they issue you a check..and if you get to the 20...then the money sits there until you get enough...all the while...the money they owe you is sitting in the bank...collecting interest to the point where it will cost them nothing to get you to do some of their surveys....i have tried it...i have to be honest and say that i didnt try it all..but i tried a couple of them and i know enough that the pay per hour is extremely low compared to just regular jobs....i would rather spend 5 dollars for gas to go to work for 10 buxx an hour for 2 hours.....at least i know i make 15 buxx....other there..some people make out if they have alot of time on hand...but for the most part...nobody has that kind of time..and even if they make out..i dont think its anywhere close to a job that supports you on ramen noodles....

Hi L,\n\nThis is a topic that I have studied in much detail over the past 3 years. There are ALOT of ways to make money online, however, the moment you log on to the internet you are bombarded by ALOT of different sites telling you how to make money and that you`ll be a millionaire overnight. It takes time to filter out the crap from the genuine income generating programs. \n\nI have researched literally thousands of the different offers I'm sure you see every day on the internet. You could spend a fortune trying all these different business opportunities out for yourself. I did and believe me 95% of them didn't work but now I'm making quite a bit using a number of different websites. \n\nOne of the ones I found worked best is Protry.com or DataEntryPros. \n\nBasically you sign up with them and then simply enter in lines of data they give you, send it back and they send you out a check! I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $200-$300. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra bit of cash aswell as my full time job (which I love!) so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepare to spend a small amount of money but just do what I did..all of these sites offer a 30 day money back guarantee..use them for 30 days, make some cash then just cancel the \nsubscription...I know you won`t though! :o) \n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nMatthew
Yes it can. If you are intoxicated in a public place or under the influence of alcohol or narcotics you can be arrested for DUI, DWI, or Public intoxication. If you are a danger to yourself or others or are considered a mental risk you can be taken into custody also for your protection. If a friend is at your home and sees Narcotics in plain view and they are a credible witness a search warrant can be obtained and your house searched and you subsequently can be arrested for what they find if it is in the warrant or not. An example would be your friend saw you smoking marijuana and you have a bag of it on your table. If your friend has given credible information before to the Police then they are proven up to be credible and a warrant is very easy to get. If a police officer is responding to a call at an apartment complex and your window is open and he/she smells you smoking a joint and looks in the window and sees you he no longer needs a warrant because in his/her training they have been trained to recognize the smell of burning marijuana and that is probable cause enough to snatch you up and hold you until a warrant can be obtained and if they can see the dope in plain view they don't even need the warrant.

Hi.\n\nI don't really have a problem with agnostics, but, then again, it all comes down to your definition of the word. If "agnostic" means someone who is skeptical about god, but not quite able to say "There is no god!" I'm fine with that. I'm very much up in the air about a lot of issues and even have opposing viewpoints about some things. It's fine to not be able to come to a hard opinion about certain things.\n\nThe issue that I do have is when agnosticism means: "The existence of god is unknowable." I just can't buy that explanation. From where I sit, everything is knowable. We may not have the tools to find the answer, or even the mental software to grasp the answer, but this doesn't mean that it is "unknowable."\n\nNow, I don't think I have a better term than "agnostic," but I do know that there has been some backlash lately (not here) from certain people who feel that people like me (hard-atheist/skeptics) have co-opted the term "skeptic" and taken away its "actual" meaning (which closely means "examiner," as opposed to "loud-mouthed nay-sayer.") These people are trying to reestablish a more traditional school of skepticism under the name zetecism (closely meaning "seekers.)\n\nSo, I don't know. Do some research and you might find that you're actually a Zetetic. I realize that it can be a difficult thing for a young woman to learn that she is actually a member of an ancient Greek school of thinking that the majority of people on Earth have never heard of, but it is a rite of passage that we must all go through. :)

Self-injuring WILL escalate over time, because the longer you do it, the deeper you need to injure in order to get the same effects you did at first, when maybe a shallow cut or wound would be enough. One girl I knew injured herself to the point where she had to get her entire arm STAPLED. I don't know if you know much about medicine, but we do not usually staple a wound closed....usually it is sutured. The last time she nearly severed her jugular (a very large and important vein in your neck). She's just lucky she didn't hit the carotid artery. She would've bled out if paramedics hadn't hauled her off to the hospital in time. I'm not trying to scare you, I'm just telling you that it's the nature of the disease. The longer you do it, the deeper you have to cut yourself to make it hurt. If it doesn't hurt, you can't feel better.

You don't have a problem with your speech professor. You have a problem with yourself and you're blaming your speech professor for trying to help you do what you signed for the class to do: speak in public.\n\nThe real question you should ask yourself is how to overcome your nervousness while in front of your class.\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1. write your main points on 3" x 5" index cards (not the whole speech, just the main points)\n2. practice in front of a mirror\n3. pick a spot someplace in the room to talk to. As you feel more comfortable, pick out four or five people to make eye contact with.\n4. I always went first... to get it out of the way.\n\nRemember, everyone gets nervous about things they're unaccustomed to. It will get easier over time. Stop blaming your instructor, they're helping you. Quit fighting yourself.

I think I understand what you're going through. I recently had radiation therapy on my overactive thyroid gland, and I have gained a lot of weight! The problem in the US is that convenient and fast food means crappy and unhealthy food. I will only order things like fish and veggies, grilled chicken and veggies, and if I HAD to do fast food, get a grilled chicken salad with no croutons, and bring your own dressing. Unfortunately this is not a dieters world, and we just have to make the best of it! Why not bring along some Nutrition shakes "just in case"? I know finding the right foods to eat on the go is a lot harder than doing it at home. Best of luck to you! :)
Of course not- It is blasphemous. It is false doctrine and taking light of our Lord and Savior- which is exactly what Satan wants the world to see. He wants people to be swept away by this ridiculous story so that they will believe anything but the truth. I know many say "oh its fiction" but you know many want to believe it- it is a deceitful movie and I will not support in any way- Nobody should take light of Jesus Christ- NOR add to His words!\n\nProverbs 30:6\nDo not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.\n\nEphesians 5:11\nHave nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

There are some great books on this, especially for getting kids to eat veggies. The books have great pics that show you how to make faces out of vegies and just make them more appealing visually. There are hundreds of great-tasting vegies at your local farmer's market or grocery store. I like to try the new ones that I discover at the store!

That would be quartz or SiO2... aka silica or silicon dioxide.\n\nThere are many forms & colors of quartz such as clear, milky, rose, smokey, citrine, amethyst, etc. It is also found as opal which is non-crystalline silica (no crystals).\n\nIt is found as sand grains, as quartz veins, & in rocks such as granite. It is also found alone such as above. SiO2 is also part of a major mineral group called the silicates.\n\nFeldspar is also common but it is one of the most common rock-forming minerals. Feldspar easily weathers & is broken down into clay in warmer wetter climates (ie southern states & the tropics)
Check out autistic subculture.\n\nThe fascinating part of this, and what should make it more accessible to you, is that most of autistic subculture exists on the Internet. With face-to-face communication difficult, we find it much more easy to communicate in writing via message boards.\n\nThe majority of these autistics are high-functioning; but there is quite a showing of nonverbal autistics who communicate only by writing.\n\nHere's one site, from which you should be able to follow links to quite a few others:\nhttp://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/\n\nOne warning: Don't pity these people or look down on them. The older ones just ignore it and make you feel awkward. The younger ones might even flame you; they've had to take enough of it in school already.

they most likely mean nothing. This appears to be one of many heretical documents created during the reign of THeospacy in England. Since many of the documents were formed by the process of 'ghost writing' (relying on spritual impulses or dreams to form content) random infomration can appear more significant than intended.\n\n-Intresting note: SOme of the names have been changed from the orginal document, according to the footnotes, based on further 'translation' of the heavenly language. It would appear that the names are suppose to have meaning in the language of 'heaven' which some teoshpists and today's new-agers belive would give them mystic power if they could learn to speak it.

The Robot Co-op has built a series of interconnected sites: 43 Things, 43 Places, and 43 People. \n\n\n43 Things lets you record a list of goals or dreams. The basic question you answer is, "What Do You Want To Do With Your Life?" 43 Places is a list of all the places you would like to visit. The place can be as specific as a particular store or as general as outer space. 43 People contains the list of people you would like to meet. Each site allows you to keep a record of the accomplishments, trips, and meetings you have achieved. Your entries can be as frequently as you like. You can also add comments to other's entries.\n\nWhen you visit other people's lists, you can choose to send them a 'cheer'. When someone sends you a cheer, it shows that they are supporting you in that particular goal.\n\nThe sites provide the functionality of uploading photos, integrate with an existing Flickr account, and be able to cross post content to your own blog elsewhere.

Technically, children born in the U.S. whose parents are not citizens of the U.S. are not automatically U.S. Citizens (contrary to popular myth). That being said, even if the child is a U.S. citizen the parents do not automatically become U.S. citizens. They must go through the naturalization process like every other citizen-to-be must.\n\nThe 17th Amendment deals with the popular election of Senators, not U.S. Citizenship. The 14th Amendmendment deals with citizenship, the due process of law, and the election of Representatives.\n\nI stand partially corrected, however. There is currently an ongoing debate whether or not children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. are automatically citizens. Since the parents have not vowed to relinquished their loyalty to their home country they are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" of the U.S. This will likely be heatedly debated for the next few years until the illegal immigration problem in this country is worked out.\n\nRegardless, the Canadian parents still need to go through the naturalization process...they cannot "automatically" become citizens.
These descirbe your rbc hemoglobin content. The MCV (mean corpuscular volume) is basically saying "how much volume is in your reb blodd cells". One of the main components of your RBCs is hemoglobin and, you need iron to make hemoglobin. Thus, a low MCV might mean that you are low on iron. BUT, your RDW is a commnet to how acccurate the MCV is - the fact that it is high says that the MCV is essentially usuless as a diagnosic number. The MCH is another measure of hemoglobin in your RBC, but MDs don't use this number much. It's just given because it's a calcualted value from the other numbers given.\n\nNone of these numbers have anyhting to do with your throid. Although, the MCV can go up or down depending on your throid status. But, again, the fact that the RDW is high negates it clinical value.\n\nBIG PICTURE: You are fine, if these are the only numbers that are off in your CBC. If you are worried about your thyroid, get specific tests for them. All you really need is a TSH.

HELL NO!
the best answer is take as many kids as you can to a hockey game. I love hockey and have from the time i could walk. I can enjoy the game very much on tv. I have noticed though that people that dont grow up with it cant on tv unless they have been introduced to the excitement of seeing it live. hockey is in my opinion the most complex of games. but that intensity is just not felt on the tv with out the excitement of seeing it and feeling the energy in person. the other thing that works is share your excitement talk it up explain the suttle things. oh yeah and tell people that their are fights lol. some times that works too
Many people use working pressure and operating pressure interchangeably. However, I don't believe the ANSI piping codes use the word rated pressure for piping systems. I believe it uses the term design pressure to define the maximum safe pressure at which a system can be operated. \n\nThe only place I can recall the code using the term rated or rating is with regards piping classes or flange ratings. It has been over ten years since I have had reason to look at the ANSI code but I believe I am correct. \n\nThe main point I would like to make is you need to be very careful what terms you use so that they are consistent with the codes you are using.
The mobo sounds like the place to start. But, first is the computer old?? It may be time for a new one! If your going to keep this one for awhile, check the CPU fan and make sure that it is running constantly. If the CPU gets too hot the computer no workie! CPU fans are a cheap fix. How about case fans? Do you have any? If not, install one or two. Hard drives and CPU's generate a lot of heat. If the computer gets too hot it shuts down! Your power source may not be big enough for the equiptment you're running. Make certain that your memory sticks are fully inserted into the dimm sockets.

I understand about wanting to go into the service. It looks like it might be a way to pay the bills and get some education and a way up. For some of us it was. I was a chemical staff specialist. My job started out being in radiation protection. That was great. It eventually got me where I am today. I teach the stuff in a nuclear power plant.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThe Army decided that they needed me to make and drop napalm, agent orange, white phosphorus, and other stuff like that. I got sent to Vietnam. I was a good soldier. Did what they told me. Even got tortured in training without talking (South Koreans broke my knee in a training exercise). I dropped napalm on people, dude. Burned them to death. Sprayed Agent Orange that we later found out caused all sorts of genetic defects and liver problems in the Vietnamese and in our troops. I watch a helicopter blade take off my pilot's head when we crashed once.\n\nDid not seem much like radiation protection somehow. \n\nAnd then when I got back people spit on me. They called us baby killers. The sentiment about the war had changed. There was no money much to treat vets either (a lot like it is now, btw) and my buddies were very screwed up. I hear that US soldiers coming back now 1 in every three are seeking help about PTSD. Yeah, good idea to seek help. I still have it. Fourth of July is hell for me. Hate unexpected fire crackers.\n\nThe job of the military is to meet with and kill the enemy. The recruiters will try to tell you there are lots of other things to do, but that is the number one job. Right now we are not at war, we are occupying a country that does not want us there. The Iraqi president and VP have both asked for us to leave, have talked about granting amnesty to those who have only killed Americans. The troops on the ground there are tired. They are there to protect the contractors who are raking in the dough on fat no-bid contracts. \n\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\nHow about something like Americorps or Peace Corps? \n\nIf you still are intent on the Army, get everything in writing. When they try to weasel out, show them the paper and leave. Seriously. Recruiters lie and cheat.

Go ahead with the bouquet/garter toss, but you don't have to do the latter part where the bachelor puts the garter on the bachelorette. \n\nSome other fun things to at your wedding: Have the d.j. ask all married couples to join you and your bride on the dance floor. Every couple of minutes he'll ask couples who've been married less than 1 year to leave the dance floor (except you and your wife), it gets whittled down to the longest married couple and you and your bride, then you exchange partners - She dances with the longest married man, you with the longest married woman. Very sweet. Hey! As an alternate to the bouquet/garter toss, you could give that couple the bouquet and garter as special memento's! \n\nCongratulations & Have fun!
The answer is found in Genesis as to how it was done:\n\nGenesis 6:19-22\n\nAnd of every living thing of all flesh,two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark,to keep them alive with thee;\nthey shall be male and female.Of fowls after their kind,\nand of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind,two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\nAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee;and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him,so did he.\n\nThe key phrase being: two of every sort shall come unto thee - meaning the animals where led to Noah by God. \n\nCome to consider it, the animals knew of the flood by their senses (even today animals know of impending danger even before it happens) and the animals moved to higher ground of which the ark was located.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nAlthough we do not know the exact length of a cubit at this time (verse 15), later, it was about 18 inches making the ark 450 feet long, 75 feet broad and 45 feet high, with a displacement of 14,000 tons its carrying capacity equalled that of 522 standard railroad stock cars (each of which can hold 240 sheep). Only 188 cars would be required to hold 45,000 sheep-sized animals, leaving three trains of 104 cars each for food, Noah's family, and 'range' for the animals. Today it is estimated that there are 17,600 species of animals, making 45,000 a likely approximation of the number Noah might have taken into the ark."

Try Monty Python movies such as "The Life of Brian", "And Now For Something Completely Differnt", or the infamous: "And the Quest for the Holy Grail." You might first want to look up Monty Python or Monty Python Flying Circus on Yahoo! videos to see if you like their humor. It's British, but extremely eccentric. Next, their is any movie by Mel Brooks (e.g. The History of the World Part I, Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood, Men in Tights, etc. etc.), or you could try Airplane! (that one is hilarious!)\nIf you can, and are a fan of zombie movies, try and watch Shaun of the Dead. Great!! It makes fun of the old zombie movies, and even includes such classic lines as "They're coming to get you Barbara!" (from the original black and white Night of the Living Dead). Great Stuff.

You have to be very careful with long distance or online relationships especially being from two different countries. If this man you say you love, asks you for any money, or asks you to let him borrow any money...dont do it!! There are many people both men and women who meet on line from different countries. They say they love you and would do anything for you, but when it comes to asking for money (what ever reason they give you), it is a scam.\n\nIf this person is a true person, I would suggest that when you have spring break from college, that you invite him to come and visit you. You are in college so I know you cant afford to spend out extra money to travell to visit him. This is one way you two can get to know eachother up front and in person. \n\nPlease do not jump the gun on this one. You need to make darn sure that this person you have a relationship is a real person. You can get his name and address and do a search to make sure it checks out. I would suggest you do a back ground check too. \n\nI know because I was in a relationship online with a man from a different country for over a year. I am a victum of being scammed.\n\nGood Luck and I hope this helps :-)
Asking 'Who's the Daddy?' is like asking who is c0ck of the walk, or who runs this place.\n\nIt is old UK prison slang.

he doesn't know enough about you to be in love with you....he's more or less infatuated (which means he "really" does like you, but in a lustful way). because some people do tend to fall quickly, they are also more likely to tire quickly as well.....fools rush in. real relationships are based on time, connections, and chemistry....take caution.
contact BT cause I'm on BT broadband 8MB and it is not cheap, but they sorted mine out and now it has 10MB and some times more but how i don't know. when u go into BT broadband help there is a option that say "contact us" click on it and tell them you're problem. they should get back to u within 24hrs if not e-mail them again, or ring them.

as a Christian, i personally cant stand when people wrap it all up into this neat little package called ooop, -love the sinner hate the sin.\nGuess what, youre a sinner, in Gods eyes a sin is a sin, to natural eyes, youre probably better at sinning than youre average gay. These are human beings people! with human emotions and feelings! Not social outcasts, not degenerats of society, we live in a society much more full of sin than homosexuality. If youre getting a visual of what someone is doing in their bedroom, and it just sickens you, well i say youve got issues. your kinda perverted for even going there yourself.\nLove your nieghbors as you would yourself. period.\nIf you dont understand their walk, where they have been, the soil they grew in, their journey, what they feel deep in their hearts, then pray that you do. try to understand, try to tolerate, and try to help from a POSITIVE place not a negative one.\nHate is negative, even hating sin, it gets us nowhere as brothers and sisters in Christ or humanity.

You are a little hard on the religious. While I agree with you mostly there are mitigating reasons for belief:\n\n1. Humans are a tribal species with an instinctive need to follow.\n2. Ignorant people, which describes humanity up until the last 100 years or so, will believe religious doctrine no matter how ridiculous.\n3. Humans invent and believe in gods in a desperate attempt to have some control over Mother Nature. \n\nThe reason churches hate secularism so much is it provides answers that work without religion. Religion is dying and they know it.

Well, 9 letter word. If all of the were different, then there would be 9! permutations.\n\nBut there are 3 N's, 2 K's, and 2 E's, 1 B, and 1 U. So, we must divide 11! by (3! * 2! * 2! * 1! * 1!).\n\nANSWER : 11! / (6 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1) = 1,663,200
In the sense that gravity is defined as the force of attraction between two bodies, due to their mass, i.e.\n\nF = gm1m2/d^2..............(1)\n\nit would seem that there are only a few ways in which this force could become negative (i.e. repulsive rather than attractive).\n\n1. If there was a universe where g, the universal gravitational constant, was negative rather than positive (not in our known universe).\n\n2. If ONE of the masses was negative (again, not comprehensible in our universe).\n\n3. If the distance between the masses was imaginary. (again, not evidenced in our universe)\n\nSo, it would seem that anti-gravity would violate our current theories.\n\nIn answer to your question, however, no, I have not experienced anti-gravity with the Levitron. Besides it is NOT anti-gravity. Gravity still opposes the force generated by the Levitron, in balance with it.

First I'd like to say, I wish more people like you would come here.\n\nBecause the US is obsessed with competiting with poverty stricken countries. The less education and job training you have, the lower wage you're willing to take, the better chance you have of coming here. My husband has a Bachelor's degree and had to take a 12 thousand dollar a year cut in pay to keep his job.\n\nThe value of our home went down several thousand dollars within one year. Utilites, other necessities and taxes all went up. 45 years of hard work down the drain all in the name of competition.\n\nOur government is working hard to bring in uneducated poor people to work at sub level wages, the goal being to bring our wages to the level of China, India and Mexico. Unfortunately, so far so good, we're looking more like Mexico everyday. \n\nWe're headed for Socialism. Our American dream is turning into a nightmare.

First, it depends on who you are and your relationship to the inmate. For the most part, that type of information is not public, and security and safety reasons, the institution will not release it. \n\nHowever, for example, if you are a wife, and your husband is about to be released, he will know the exact day. Then you can arrange with the institution for the time that you can meet him.\n\nIf you are a victim of the inmate, again, release is not public information.
Someone posted these links in a similar question not long ago. I hope you find them helpful.
Hello,\n\nShe should go see a medical doctor first!! Her MD will run tests to find our WHY she has the goitre and will be able to advise her about surgery, medications, dietary and lifestyle changes.\n\nIf the MD is not helpful, she should DEFINITELY consult a **registered dietician** (NOT a 'nutritionist' or a non-accredited 'diet specialist').\n\nFor your information:\n\nOur thyroid uses Iodine to create important hormones (T3, T4). She needs to be very careful about her Iodine intake (ie iodized salt, seafood). Since her thyroid is enlarged, it may be like a giant sponge for Iodine and this can be **dangerous** if her Iodine intake is increased too quickly.\n\nNext, she would be very wise to limit her intake of soy and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, etc). Scientific studies have demonstrated that these foods interfere with Iodine uptake by the thyroid. For the same reason, avoiding products with 'rapeseed' is important too. It is very, very difficult to find any foods or oils that contain rapeseed now so this shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nALSO, she should ** NOT become pregnant**; it puts a major stress on her body AND her children will have major birth defects (known as cretinism).\n\nHope this helps!\n:)

I don't think the question is stupid at all and if it is any consolation, the people that snicker at your question will probably roll on the floor at my response. Some time ago I was doing research in St. Louis. Now, I don't know if it is because of a certain popular series set in and around the area or other reasons, but St. Louis has a fairly large number of people that claim to be supernatural creatures or possess magical abilities. I interviewed dozens of witches, vampires, aliens and no less than 6 varieties of shapeshifters including werewolves. The 'Aliens' were less than impressive, the Witches completely convinced me of their authenticity, a couple of the 'Vampires' gave a very impressive demonstration. And then there were the shapeshifters..... most balked at giving me any 'proof' of what they claimed... the usual responses were 'has to be a full moon' or 'I am too dangerous when I change'. One interview, however, said why not? Without breaking line-of-sight with me he proceeded to give me his 'proof'. First he smiled and suddenly his jawline didn't look quite right... it wasn't the slow streching out of a muzzle like in the movies, but it suddenly wasn't shaped right and all his teeth were sharp little points. Then his eyes went yellow.. it was like he blinked and they changed, I didn't see his hands go near his face, they just changed. My first thought was: "Wow! Great slight of hand, I didn't even see him put the teeth or contacts in! And those are really great contacts and great fake teeth!" . My second thought was: "Don't the idiots that stand there screaming or just watching the change usually get eaten? Or end up terminally furry?" \nI left the scene. Very quickly. The interview contacted me later and appologized, even offered to do the demonstration some where of my choosing. I declined. So, I don't think the question is dumb because I am not sure either. Was it (as logic would demand) a really, really, really good act..... or was I in a room with a real life werewolf?

Reality. What you find with extreme partisans and I include extremist right wingers as well as the left wing is that when their claims are proved false they just change rhetoric. As to the what they have said before, they will either never mention it again, or deny that they ever said it in the first place if challenged. When denials do not work they resort to the final tactic in their arsenal which is too discredit anyone who doesn't agree as stupid or intolerant depending on the issue.\n\nWow, what short memories some people have. Did those posting that it was never stated live through the eighties? There was constant rhetoric in the media and political circles to this effect. I don't remember how many times a week we heard that Mr. Reagan was just a dangerous cowboy who was going to lead us into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union and that our goals would never be achieved.
There are a few explainations.\n\n1.) Fly Ash is much cheaper than cement. With the prices of natural gas and the fact that production of cement requires a rotary kiln that is heated by natural gas the cost of cement has gone through the roof. From my understanding a ton of cement has increased in price by like 20% over the last year or so.\n\n2.) Fly Ash is a natural pozzulan and water reducer. Fly ash lowers the water requirements of the concrete mix making for a much stronger concrete. Fly ash slows early strength gains but increases late strength gains as well as increasing workability. Think of it like this. You put rocks in a jar and there's voids, then you fill in those voids with sand, water, and cement but there's still small voids so you use fly ash to fill those in. You can still have voids and use other things to fill those in but that's for another question.\n\n3.) Fly Ash is a waste material (from coal fired power plants i believe don't quote me). The federal government requires its use in some of its projects or at the very least recommends it. It is considered a green material and i read an article in Concrete Construction magazine (Jan 2006 issue) about HVFA (high volume fly ash) mixes. They will replace like 51% of the cement with Fly Ash in the mix and get tremendous late strengths out of the concrete.\n\nThese are three of the main reason's for the use of fly ash. As sustainable building (green construction) continues to gain backing you'll probably find more use of fly ash in concrete. Also with it being cheaper people will want it used.\n\nStrictly speaking Fly Ash DOES NOT increase the density of the concrete. Fly Ash has a specific gravity of about 2.00 (meaning for a given volume it weighs 2 times the same volume of water), Cement has a specific gravity of about 3.15. If you have 3 cubic feet of cement then it will weigh 589.68 pounds (3 x 62.4 x 3.15). If you substitue 1.5 cubic feet of that for Fly Ash then you will have [(1.5 x 62.4 x 2.00)+(1.5 x 62.4 x 3.15)] or 187.2 + 294.84 = 482.04 lbs. (a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds i believe). Fly ash actually lowers the unit weight of the concrete, because for a given volume it weighs 63.5% of what portland cement does.

Because they dont have water filters to purify thier water. All thier waste gets dumped into local rivers, streams, or lakes, and without a pump or purification system they are forced to drink the water to survive even though the water is so contaminated with parasites, fungus, and hundreds of diseases. The contaminated water, in most 3rd world countries, also makes it almost impossible to find any food or animals around the water sources. So even if the people didnt drink the water, they would still be influenced due to the food and animals they eat.
It goes back to nearly the beginning of football when the first quartbacks where created to take the snap of the ball from the center (or ball snapper). The word set was to tell all the players on the field to get set (get in place) because the play (the snapping of the ball) was soon to happen. However, the history of "hut" is more obsecure. It is know that for many years prior to the adoption of the word "hut" into the use of army drill sargents by saying "hut, 2, 3, 4" so it is possible it was incorporated into football because it was easier to hear than a number while maintaining discipline among the players on the field. I hope this helps.
Of course you already know you have to relax, but you have to be really ready too. Ready for sex in general, not just anal. Watch some videos or read a book, have a drink, flirt - get all worked up. Then, start out with small toys or fingers (with plenty of lube - that cavity doesn't lube itself.) Try moving up to larger toys during several sessions (if he knows what's good for him, he will be patient.) You will know when you are ready for him. I find it enjoyable but not all the time. You have to want to.
Its also common to have a first name MARIA which is Mary mother of Jesus. Even for guys in Spain they are called Maria Jose which is for both man and woman (In Spain again).\nIn Mexico its a reverence to Jesus. Mexico is mainly all Catholic and people are very faithful (well the majority inMexico). It is an honor to have the name of Jesus.\n\nJoseph or Peter are apostles not Jesus, the son of God and the Christ.\n\nIts a very good question.\nI think the answer lays in the upbringing as Catholics.\nThe Popes in the Vatican which is Catholics main leader for the Church and the one that is directly inspired and chosen by God all the way to lead all of God's children, their original names are not used but choose a name after an apostle. Thus JOHN PAUL II.\nWhose name from his native Poland is not that, it is Karol Woytila. And he was a great human being who not only brought down the Berlin wall down and united millions around the world. He did much good for humanity and set an excellent example of forgiveness and compassion for our fellow humankind.\nHe forgave and actually went to see in jail his Turkish would be assasin, the one who almost killed him. The turkish guy was so moved by His HOllyness that he converted to Christianity and asked John Paul II for his forgivness. When John Paul II died, the turkish man that almost killed him asked to be given permission to go to his burial and did go to his burial.\n\nWhat a way to forgive someone who almost kill you. Dont you think? \nthe power of forgivness and love that Karol Woytila had ws not a coincidence he got to be a Pope and spread the Gospel as he did, from countyr to country, the one and only Pope who hs visited more than 30 countries in the world to tell humans LOVE, FORGIVE, BELEIVE IN GOD THAT IS THE GOD OF ALL HUMANITY. NOT JUST THE GOD OF ISRAEL , OR MY GOD HE SAID, BUTYOUR GOD.\n\nNames in cultures deep in faith to God choose a name not for fun, but for this reason. Reverence to God and Christ.\n\nhey zeus is not qauiet the actual pronunciation in Spanish. But i cant spell it here the way it s said. more like Hezoos (he as in the word "hermit" getting rid of the rmit just "he") if you say Hey its pronounced with an american accent.\n\ntO BE NAMED JESUS MEANS A LOT TO LATINOS AND SPANIARDS. \nANTOHER misconception, latinos are from latin america that means from Mexico and south all the way to Patagonia.\nSpaniards are people from Spain. And we are not latinos. But spanish speakers yes, though the language is very different even if commonly people think ITS SPANISH. Spanish in all different countries is all not the same language. Words change meanings cchange and waht may have some meaning in Mexico, in Spain it has a complete different meaning. \n\nIt may also be that in Spanish we have closer link to latin based language. Where the word Jesus is pronounced not as in the USA that stands apart form the pronunciation of its orignal language of the old . Aramaic. (I dont knwo if i spelled Aramaic right). ARAMAIC IS THE LANGUAGE JESUS CHRIST SPOKE.
Take a look at the U.S. and decide for yourself. Would the U.S. be as successful if it were a collection of 50 independant states, each responsible for its own treaties, currency, and armed forces? The redundancy and inability to coordinate and consolidate efforts would likely render the whole as ineffective.\n\nThere should be, however, reasonable limitations on the powers of the chief executive of the federation. The U.S. bestows tremendous powers on its President.
I take Atenolol for mvp. It's a beta blocker that's usually used to lower blood pressure. I do have mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and this takes some of the strain off my heart so it doesn't try to overcompensate. Yes, i still have the prolapse, but it does control the symptoms and arrythmias.\n\nMost people with mvp don't need medication, though. For the lucky few who do need it, Atenolol is quite common.

No, it doesn't. But it does make it appear this way. Before you shave the hair is different lengths and some of it lighter. When you shave and it grows back it is all the same length and darker because it hasn't had a chance to get bleaced by the sun, therefore it looks like it is thicker and darker. Shaving can not change the way hair grows out from the pores, it cuts it off at the surface.
First why are you posting this in the dating category?\n\nA ford Escape is more styllish. Works like a beauty on the beach, I love mine.
Dude. Mentos and Diet Coke. Sweet. Someone's already mentioned it, but I will be a good scientist wannabe and provide a little more information here.\n\nI think diet has more oxygen than others. You could test a couple of different sodas to see. It's showing a physical reaction between the nucleation sites on the candy (imperfections, etc. that allow bubbles to form) and the gas in the soda. The gas wants to form bubbles, and a nucleation site is where it can do so. The candy sinks to the bottom of the soda bottle, making the reaction last awhile. All those bubbles have nowhere to go but up. \n\nYour experiment could be to see what soda does it the most, or what candy has the most nucleation sites (for six year olds, you could call them "bubble sites" or something). Have them guess why the bubbles go up. They might be able to figure out that it is because bubbles are made of gas and gas is lighter. Hmm. That brings us to solid, liquid, and gas; something they might have heard about in science class if they've been in first grade.\n\nYou'll want to try it at home first (but as a good camp counselor, you already know that). \n\nAnother avenue you could explore is ecology. Something like which food ants will eat first. If you flood an ant hill (be careful they aren't the biting/stinging kind of ants), you can watch them evacuate their colony and carry their larvae away in a struggle for self-preservation. That's kind of mean, though. I bet they'd love to play with Mentos and Diet Coke. I'm sure you could do a wonderful job explaining to them about bubbles and getting them to hypothesize about where the bubbles come from.\n\nGood luck!

It depends on what you mean by nice upper body. Strength or appearance? You will not be able to see the results unless you tone down (or up I guess) overall. You can target muscles but you can't spot reduce. Example: You could have awesome abs but never see them because all you've done is crunches and haven't toned the rest of your body. Cardio and weight lifting are great ways to reduce excess fat. If your body is already trim, then you will see your results. There are many areas of the upper body to work: triceps, biceps, deltoids, lats, traps,... Push ups and sit ups will not engage all of these muscles.

First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nWhat is a Soul?\nRight in the very first book of the Bible, Genesis, we are told that the soul is not something you have, it is something you are. We read of the creation of Adam, the first human being: “The man came to be a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) The Hebrew word used here for soul, ne'phesh, occurs well over 700 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, never once conveying the idea of a separate, ethereal, spiritual part of man. On the contrary, the soul is tangible, concrete, physical.\n\nLook up the following cited texts in your own copy of the Bible, for the Hebrew word ne'phesh is found in each of them. They clearly show that the soul can face risk, danger, and even be kidnapped (Deuteronomy 24:7; Judges 9:17; 1 Samuel 19:11); touch things (Job 6:7); be locked up in irons (Psalm 105:18); crave to eat, be afflicted by fasting, and faint from hunger and thirst; and suffer from a wasting disease or even insomnia as a result of grief. (Deuteronomy 12:20; Psalm 35:13; 69:10;) In other words, because your soul is you, your very self, your soul can experience anything you can experience.\n\nDoes that mean, then, that the soul can actually die? Yes. Far from being immortal, human souls are spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures as being “cut off,” or executed, for wrongdoing, being struck fatally, murdered, destroyed, and torn to pieces. (Exodus 31:14; Deuteronomy 19:6; 22:26; Psalm 7:2) “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die,” says Ezekiel 18:4. Clearly, death is the common end of human souls, since all of us sin. (Psalm 51:5) The first man, Adam, was told that the penalty for sin was death—not transfer to the spirit realm and immortality. (Genesis 2:17) And when he sinned, the sentence was pronounced: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) When Adam and Eve died, they simply became what the Bible often refers to as ‘dead souls’ or ‘deceased souls.’\n\nSome people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ?\n\nBible writers used the Hebrew word ru´ach or the Greek word pneu´ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [God] take away their spirit [ru´ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu´ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru´ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah’s day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru´ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures.

Children, sometimes cry if they do not know you, because they are scared of strange people or if they are kids from friends of yours there is a simple solution to your problem. Playing peek-a-boo with them if they are small babies would make them warm towards you. If older try to start a conversation by telling them your name and asking them theirs. And remember that children can sense when a person is sincere.

A State is an independent territory with a government, a population and sovereignty over these. The entire landmass of the Earth (excluding Antarctica), along with coastal seas is considered to be divided among such countries. There are currently 193 States (countries) recognised by the United Nations — its 192 members and the Vatican City.\n\nIn addition to these, there are other non sovereign territories which, under the philosophy of self-determination, wish to be considered countries in this sense. Some of these have de facto control over their population and territory, such as Abkazia, but are not considered States as they are not recognised as having sovereignty. On the other hand, in some internationally-recognised States, there is no functioning central government or there are several de facto States and governments. These are internationally not considered to constitute separate States, but rather to exist on the territory of the internationally recognised State.\n\nLook in the following link for names

No!!! John Cena didn't deserve that. I can't stand Umaga and Big Show anymore!! I hope that John Cena kicks their rears as soon as he can. Big show and Umaga need to be taught a lesson. I wish I was the general manager of Raw, I'd make a match that Big Show and Umaga would never forget. I'd let what happened to John Cena, happen to them, but only 10 times worse. I'd hire some ECW wrestlers and other Raw and Smackdown wrestlers too.

The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\n\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\n\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\n\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother.

I say first of all you need to face her with her lies and tell her how sick of them you are. Tell her if she wants a friendship with her husbands family she will have to stop all the gossip and baloney. Otherwise, avoid her like the plague.\n\nDo speak to your brother when he's around though. He may have sided with her, but you're still his flesh and blood and I'm sure he misses your friendship. He can't do anything about his wife..........it's got to be her willing to change.

Yes, and more. By crash dieting (using the definition of extreme caloric restrition) you have convinced your body that it needs to store any energy it consumes rather than use it to power the body. In other words, you have told it to get fat. \nThat is why eating 6 small meals a day is the best for losing weight. As an example, if you are a normal healthy adult female you need about 1200 cals a day on average to power your body. So eat 6 small meals of 200 cals each (good cals, NOT candy bars!) with protien, dairy, fruits and nuts being your focus and you will lose weight (providing you burn 1200 cals!) because your body will see that you have enough food to survive and it does not need to store the energy rather than conserve it.
I discovered a configuration mismatch\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 370 (1.5GHz) 1MB L2, 400MHz FSB\nRAM: 768MB (256 + 512) PC4200 DDR2 533MHz \n\nThe clock frequency of the RAM may not be higher than the clock frequency of the FSB. Every manufacturer of a mainboard with FSB 400MHz would recommend RAM of the types PC2100 or PC2700.\nThis might not be the reason for your hangs/freezes, but the timing of PC4200 DDR RAMs on a 400MHz FSB is critical anyway.
The fire is believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the capsule's 30 miles (50 km) of wiring. Due to the pure oxygen inside the capsule (which was at a pressure of 15 psi or 100 kPa) the fire was quickly out of control. The Apollo 204 Review Board determined that a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the command module pilot's couch had become stripped of its insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of an associated access door. This weak point in the wiring also happened to pass near a junction in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line, which had developed a leak. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the anode made of silver resulted in a violent exothermic reaction that ignited the ethylene glycol mixture, which in turn was able to burn in the atmosphere of pure pressurized oxygen.[1] A similar March 1961 incident had previously claimed the life of Soviet cosmonaut trainee Valentin Bondarenko when the pure oxygen atmosphere in the isolation chamber he had been occupying had caught fire, a calamity the USSR had, for years, concealed from the public. The NASA investigation found that a bar of aluminum can burn like wood in a pure Oxygen atmosphere. It also found substandard wiring in the craft and a missing socket wrench that was ruled out as the fire's cause. Many items on board were flammable, and flammable velcro had been applied to the walls of the craft to secure items in weightless conditions.\n\nThe fire spread quickly and within seconds was an inferno. As a result of toxic smoke and malfunctioning gas masks, ground crew needed five minutes to open the hatch and suppress the flames. The fire had melted the astronauts' space suits and the air lines which connected them to the capsule's life support systems. Grissom's and White's suits were found to have fused together. It was evident from how the corpses lay that they had tried to get out, but they never had a chance. Ed White, who was supposed to open the hatch, was partway out of his harness and had apparently made an effort to escape. The procedure would have had Grissom lower White's headrest, and White proceed to unlatch over 12 bolts to release the hatch. Indeed, even if he were to accomplish that, the internal pressure had risen so high that the inward-opening hatch could not have been opened. Chaffee's job was to begin shutting down the spacecraft and maintain communications with ground control. He was found dead still strapped into his right hand seat. Only 17 seconds from the first call of "Fire!", all three were dead.\n\nIt was later confirmed that the crew had actually died of smoke inhalation rather than burns. According to the Report of the Apollo 204 Review Board — Appendix D Panel 11, (link provided below), Grissom suffered third degree burns on 36% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 60% of his body) and his spacesuit was 70% destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on 40% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 48% of his body) and his spacesuit was 25% destroyed. Chaffee suffered third degree burns on 23% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 29% of his body) and his spacesuit was 15% destroyed.

In the minds of some scolars, they think that it's possible\nthe 10 commandments were inspired by the code of Hammurabi.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely the other way. Though the Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar put Moses and his life events after Hammurabi, it should be noted that the timeline get a bit fuzzy after Solomon completed the temple. I mean that the Bible didn't tell Jesus was born XXXX years after the completion of the temple by Solomon.\n\nMy own personal calculation and research put Moses' adventure somewhere around the mid third millenium BC.

There is one major problem. Electrolyzing the two elements (separating the H2 from O) requires more energy to separate it than it releases. There is no cost effective way to break the bonds, currently. The only plus about H2 for Fuel Cell cares is that it lasts longer than batteries (H2 does not die out), 1 L of compressed H2 takes you as far as 1 L of petrol, and it is clean burning.\n\nHowever, the only energy abundant enough to separate the bonds comes from coal, oil, and natural gas. And since the 1st law of thermodynamics is correct we will be using more energy to make H2 to power our cars than we will at our homes.

Being "Black Listed" isn't a formal list. It refers to a bad reputation that makes someone a less than desirable employee, making it hard for them to get employed.\n\nThe most famous was the Communist witch hunt. In this instance, it was created by the government. Many intellectuals, actors, writers, etc. found themselves unable to get employment because the refused to take part in the witch hunt. Government agencies threatened harassment if any employer hired these people.\n\nThe government has also made these "Virtual black lists" for other reasons. Howard Stern could claim this. In early days, many comedians found themselves in this situation because their routines were considered too racy.\n\nSome scientists have also claimed government harassment because they spoke out against the governemnt policies or left government employment.\n\nSocial institutions can also create a virtual black list. In these instances, they typically try to use economic pressure to prevent employment of individuals. \n\nA person can be black listed if they gain a bad reputation in their industry. For example, if an engineer or architect designed a bridge, building, or other structure that failed, they might not be able to get employment in their industry, even if they are cleared later.\n\nA person can also be "Black listed" for famous behavior or notoriety shunned by society. For example, if someone was accused of a well publicized crime and later found innocent, the reputation of the accusation could follow them making employment difficult.\n\nIf a person has had a lot of difficulties at several employers, they can find themselves black listed as their bad reputation follows them from 1 employer to the next.\n\nYou can also find yourself black listed in a company because of a well known goof up or just because a higher level manager doesn't like you. This can effect pay raises, how you are treated, and your general level of happiness in a company.\n\nIn summary, to be effective, black listing requires at least 1 of the following:\n-Government involvement\nInvolvement by a social institution (such as religion)\n-Well publicized notariety\n-A small community (a small town)\n-A small industry with few employers

I am just worried that if we investigate too much, Mars will attack! Oh my. \n\nSeriously tho, or as serious as I can get, I have read that they have found great quantities of frozen hydrogen just under the soil. The interesting thing about frozen hydrogen is that it is the basis for water. Perhaps if Mars ever did have a "thick" atmosphere, when it was ripped away, the oxygen "boiled" out and all that was left was the hydrogen.

florida gators\n\nAfter Year 1 of the Urban Meyer coaching regime, the Gators were playing in January. And this was after a season that had some pitfalls until Meyer adjusted his spread option scheme at midseason to accommodate quarterback Chris Leak’s dropback passing talents. Though top receiver Chad Jackson has split for the pros, Andre Caldwell and Dallas Baker make for some inviting downfield targets for the strong-armed Leak. Caldwell missed most of last season with a broken leg after catching 43 passes for 689 yards in 2004. \n\nDuring the offseason, Meyer expressed chagrin over the situation at tailback, saying he’ll play without one unless someone takes charge. The starter is DeShawn Wynn. All three of the backs who played significantly last fall are back, and Wynn, a senior who has run for 19 touchdowns over his career, could finish with a bang. But he’ll have to do it behind an offensive line that returns only one starter — Steve Rissler, who is moving from guard to center. \n\nThe Gators will field the best defensive line in the SEC. End Jarvis Moss led the team with 11 tackles for a loss and 7.5 sacks, and he was only used in passing situations. Tackle Marcus Thomas broke through for 10.5 tackles behind the line. Florida is also blessed with two of the league’s most talented linebackers in Earl Everett and Brandon Siler, the team’s top two tacklers from a year ago.

By putting the entire blame on Germany and compelling them to pay a huge war indemnity they hurt the German people who suffered during the Depression.Hitler was a charismatic orator who proved to the German people that the Treaty Of Versailles was a great injustice and they followed him into war.This is how Hitler was successful in arousing German nationalism,Nazism and offcourse starting the second world war.\n\nPersonal opinion:Personally, I believe the Treaty was a great bane for the Germans who suffered from years of unemployment and poverty.If the conditions of the Treaty were a little more mild the Germans would probably have not taken Hitler upon his word.

Please do note that this was not a "deal" that the administration cooked up. It was a sale of a business by a private company which required, like many other sales involving work in the U.S., review by the administration to make sure it meets legal muster. Nor was the "deal" covert -- it was made public several months ago (when the leading bidder for the London company's business -- a Singapore company-- withdrew their offer).\n\nSo, as a matter of legal fairness, if the company has followed all the U.S. laws there is no proper reason to disallow the sale. To do so, on no legal grounds, is to tell an Arab country which has, since 9-11 been very helpful in combatting terrorism (in precisely such areas as port security, esp. container inspection), that the rules we apply to all other nations don't apply to them. That would also discourage other Arab countries thinking of co-operating with us from thinking it's worth doing so.\n\nThere may also be some specific ways the UAE has helped us in the past few years that the administration cannot, for security reasons, give details about (i.e., you don't want to divulge what you know about terrorist groups you are pursuing, nor all the sources of that information, because that would put them at risk and dry up potential sources, who would fear being outted themselves). Of course, the administration would want to CONTINUE to get this kind of help and nixing business sales might threaten such assistance going forward.\n\nAs for the question, 'why a UAE business, not an American one?' Simple answer: NO American companies bid to purchase the London company's business. They were welcome to do so. But, in fact, there really are not any American companies vying to manage these port terminal operations. And again, the administration was never "pushing" for Dubai Port Worlds to make this purchase. That agreement was made between the parties before the U.S. government had any involvement in the matter.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to inform yourself about what exactly the "business" is, who would be doing the actual work etc. (Short answer -- it is basically about loading and unloading boats in specific port terminals, NOT running the entire port, much less port security; the on site workers will continue to be the AMERICAN dock workers who worked for the London company selling the business.)\n\nThese, any a few other points, were made (more clearly) in an email from Bush administrations officials a couple of weeks ago. I don't have a copy of the full text, but a number of excerpts may be found at the link below.

The govt. may take your property so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Increasing a tax base is a legitimate state interest. Note however, that states may enact more stringent laws, not allowing the state govt to take property for private development, so if you don't like your state's rule then petition your state legislators.

I consider myself a bible believer, because I read and live the word of God like he say do. I'm not perfect, but I'm striving for perfection, and when I see Christ, then I will be perfect, but until then, I must walk the word, speak the word, --with the fruits of the spirit. Without the fruits', you can't see if you living the word, because the fruits play a big part in walking, talking and living this word, that's how people see the word in you. So. I am a big fan of God, which make me a true bible believer..

As someone has already said, empires rise and fall. One of the first signs of weakness is when a country thinks it is so powerful that it can do what it wants. I think the US has stood for lots of good things in the past and has helped a lot of countries but Guantanamo, for example, lessens its moral authority. The war in Iraq seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. They had to nail some bad guy (with the right ethnic and/or religious background) whether he had anything to do with 9/11 or not. You expect things like this from a totalitarian government, not from the US. They would have been a lot better off concentrating on Afghanistan where they could have made a real difference. \n\nHowever, if the US works more closely with other countries which, by the way, have had democracy for as long or longer, they will do a lot better than following the adage "my way or highway". As a great admirer of Roosevelt and Lincoln I can only shake my head in dismay when I think of the commander in chief you have now. The sooner he goes, the quicker the US will make ammends. By the way, I am no admirer of the Democrats. I just like people in charge who know what they are doing.
This is a very big question, and is going to get a lot of press in this coming election year.\n\nI think I agree with President Bush that we need to have "guest workers" here in the States, because most American workers would prefer to sit on their butts and live on welfare rather than work picking crops or doing other menial labor that these "guest workers" would do. If we had to pay a wage high enough to attract American workers for these jobs, then imagine how much a loaf of bread or a pound of potatoes would cost.\n\nI do not approve of foreigners entering this country illegally, or staying in this country illegally and becoming a drain on society while they're here. If they do not register as guest workers, then they should be rounded up and sent back where they came from.
I agree with you 100% . I too am an athiest, but I have great respect for the teachings of the religions, whether Islam, Jdaism, Christianity, Hindu etc. The basic belief is summed up by the Christian commandment of "do unto others..." \n\nThe problem comes when we get an "our god's better than your god" type of confrontation, because that is just using religion as a tool to promote racism, and that is absolutely against everything that most religions stand for!\n\nI'll get off my soap box now.

The regional progressive primary is definitely a better idea than ONE national primary. The purely national approach would make it impossible for anyone to compete but those who could spend the big bucks immediately in the major population centers (big states like California, New York), and would very much cut against the historic concern --still seen in the much misunderstood and unfarily maligned Electoral College-- of allowing various states and regions to have a say in the selection of the President, not just big population centers.\n\nAnother note -- the criticism of our 'founding fathers' for the part and primary system is rather offbase. The Constitution had NOTHING about parties, and most of our leaders initially railed AGAINST the formation of specific parties... but it still happened in the 1790s, and proved a more constuctive way to resolve issues than the focus on personalities that happened when there was not a functioning two-pary system (which could get quite personal and bitter, as both John Adams and his son found out). \n\nAs for the whole primary system, that is later still, after the convention system was in place. (The first 'party convention' --with delegates from the various states-- was held by the newly organized "Democratic" party that made Andrew Jackson their, ultimately successful, candidate for President in 1828.)

The mirena coil and ovarian cyst could be related. One of the side effects of the mirena coil is endometriosis. Also, however, ovarian cysts can come and go, and possibly (even though 40 is a bit young) you could be in para-menopausal and sometimes ovarian cysts can develop yet dissolve on their own. Also, at 40 your metabolism will begin to slow down, so it's best to watch your calorie intake and keep up daily exercise to avoid weight gain. At 40 your body begins not to want to metabolize all the sweets and fats that it handled when you were younger. As for the Prozac; how long have you been on it? Even though Prozac, when you first start taking it, causes a decrease in appetite, after you have been on it for possibly a couple of years, a side effect can be just the opposite. All in all, 40 is a great age. Enjoy this next decade. It could be the best time of your life.

Wiki has information, i don't.
You are considered to be a sole proprietor, and will file a Schedule C with your personal income tax return (1040). IF you have no sales, but your intent is to produce income, you do still have a business. The IRS won't let this go on forever, but does understand that starting a business takes some time. \nYou certainly can deduct almost all of your expenses, however, some things can be deducted now, and some things must be depreciated, or taken over the expected life of the item. For instance, office supplies and utilities can be taken in one year, but buildings and equipment must usually be depreciated. What you can deduct and how it is deducted depends on what the business is, where it is located, and how it operates. I'll agree that you don't need an accountant, as long as you are keeping good records on your own. I do business taxes all the time for people who do their own books. I also own my own business (seperate from my tax job), and am familiar with deductions. \nOn the Schedule C, you'll need to show whatever sales you actually made, and then take your deductions from that in order to stay legal. The Sch.C has lines for all of that information, and I'll attach a copy, as well as instructions. Be aware: it is possible to have what is called a Net Operating Loss, allowing you negative income. This can be carried from one year to the next because you typically cannot take it all in one year. \nYou also need to be aware of the Schedule SE for what is called Self-Employment tax. This is the form that has you pay your Social Security and Medicare taxes which would otherwise be withheld form your paycheck. While you don't pay this tax if you have zero or negative income, you will eventually - 'cause your business is going to take off:)\nAlso, when you're looking at things you can deduct, keep in mind that you may have the ability to put money into an IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE plan, depending on your income and needs. Your contributions to these are generally deductible, and this helps you plan for your future as well. \nAnd now to defend myself. One of the other answerers suggested that you not go to an "H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt type place". I do not know what it takes to work at JH, so please don't take this as a slam on them. However, to work for H&R Block, you must be able to do a basic Schedule C and SE. To work for HRB for more than one year, you must take continuing education of at least 24 hours (going to 30 soon) in the off-season. I don't usually promote HRB on here, because I do work for them, but in this case, I'd hate to see you pay a lot to an accountant if you don't have to. Call ANY reputable tax preparation service and ask for someone who is knowledgable about Self-Employment. Talk to them about what you can and cannot deduct specific to your business. This information should be available to you at no charge (if someone wants to charge you for this, I'd leave and go elsewhere). And finally, tax preperation fees are indeed deductible for both individuals and businesses in different ways. So are any legal fees or professional association fees you may encounter. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. You can e-mail me through the Y! Answers site... keeps me accountable so that I'm not accused of trolling for clients, which I hope is not how this is taken :)

I think it will be a tough and gritty series for both teams. Having said that, England will be suffering for the lack of Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan, who were both key players last time. Also, the late loss of Tresco will damage their chances. Australia is a tough tour, and the hard pitches have a habit of taking their toll on visiting bowlers. Harmison and Flintoff are both recovering from injuries, but will need to bowl long spells which could take their toll.\nHowever, the England team are young and enthusiastic, which will give them plenty of determination. They also have plenty of talent in KP, Flintoff, Strauss etc.\nAustralia though, I feel, have just too much experience. Yourself, and Hayden, when you two get going build awesome platforms for the team to go onto big totals. Punter is in the best form of his life and has scored 1483 runs at 78 including 8 tons since the Ashes. If he gets going, We should be scoring 500+ scores. Then Hussey, well what a talent. Marto has a doubt but with Clarke and Jacques both pressing for a spot the middle should fire more than last year. Gilchrist doesn't even need a mention, except to say that Englands strategy of bowling around the wicket and moving it away shouldn't work as well in Oz as the extra bounce should give his the chance to cut and pull more often, which we all know he does with devestating effect. Brett Lee, McGrath and Warney will all fire up and do the job, and whoever gets the nod out of Watson, Clark, Tait or Johnson will be very keen to impress, and with the benefit of the extra bounce at home, the youngsters should bowl fast, and make life tough for England's inexperienced batsmen.\nI think it will be closer than a lot of people back home will be thinking. I think the home crowds, and the conditions will just be a little too much for such a young inexperienced England team. Don't worry, there are plenty of Aussies over here in London who will be sitting up late at night and cheering you boys along, and we are taking the stick from the Poms for you, so get stuck in, good luck, and here's to a summer of runs for you boys.\nAus to win 2-1.

In most cases,where purses are taken , they want what is easy to take....cash. They then throw your purse in the ditch or dumpster to get it out of their possession. Since you had a cell phone it may have been used, need to have service cut off. As for you personal items you should contact each one and advise of theft. You should live a little wiser due to the fact you are worried about someone coming to your home, although it doesn't usually happen. Check with your homeowners insurance, theft is sometimes covered. Unless someone knows the suspect by his video picture,I doubt he will be caught.

I supported George Bush, and I still do. I once lived in Massachusetts and had Kerry as my senator. In addition to being in bed with the Kennedys, he was a real disappointment. He did and has done nothing memorable as a senator and would make a terrible president. I'd even vote for Hilary over him, and I am a dyed in the wool Republican.

Asset verification means checking to make sure someone has something valuable that they said they had. \n\nFor instance, if you go to the bank and ask to borrow money, and tell them that you have a nice boat and a nice car, the ban will verify that you have those assets before lending you money. The reason they want to verify is that if you don't pay the money back, they'll want to take those assets from you to pay off the loan.

You have to play psychologist because that's your job... The success of the project ultimately comes down to one person, the project manager, but that hardly seems fair because any number of people are working on that project. In theory, happy people are more productive right? And you want to get the most out of everyone who is working with you right? You don't have to be one, just learn to play the role.
Klinsman picked lehmann over kahn saying it was a tough choice but lehmann has played better lately. I bet costa rica wouldn't have scored on kahn though, although I didn't see the goal because I'm listening on the radio.\n\nUPDATE: I think Kahn will be playing again before this thing is over. Giving up a 2nd goal to Costa Rica (with 10 players no less) is unbelievable.

If you are speaking in regards to the United States, then you will get many different answers. I see a left wing trying to push us to a socialist government. I like the one we have. I see people making hero's and millionaires out of complete morons who can do nothing but dress well, or maybe dribble a ball. I see hollyweird with their agenda that "Everything should be allowed" attitude. I see young girls having babies out of wedlock at an alarming rate and to them its no big deal. The government will just take care of it. I see kids getting fatter by the day, of course their brains are much lighter. I see more gang activity,and not enough family interaction. I'm really very tired of the whiners. Everybody wants something, everyone wants attention. That is why I have been extremely thankful for the conservative movement in this country. I certainly don't want to go as far right as some, but it draws us away, out of the dredges of the left wing dependent whiners.
its going to happen, but not anywhere near our lifetime
you answered your own question...you keep the same past relationships...move on. you said you played or got played with these women...fair exchange so no robbery. put out what you want to get back for starters. don't hate the players, hate the game...especially since its of your own making. why don't you rest your mind and your body...take a break, do some good things to and for yourself. after awhile get back out there and play it as it lays or not, and just take your chances. i find that the worst case of lonesome, is when someone is right there with you. having somebody is not always better than having nobody, if they aren't the right one. \n\nmaybe you keep the past connections because you know what these women will do. this means you can't be hurt or disappointed by them anymore. it sounds like you are afraid to be alone. you probably judge other women based on these past experiences. if you keep dealing with the same type of women...that's on you. examine your own expectations and make the necessary adjustments if you want a different outcome.
my opinion is that someone that drinks & drives & takes a life deserves the death penalty. Sorry to sound so harsh but my bro in law's cousin got hit by a drunk driver while she was driveing her taxi. She gave birth 2 months early & the baby died 2 weeks later & the guy killed the passenger in her car. So two lives i have no pitty for drunk drivers i dont care how damn good of a person you are. They can rott in hell.
I managed an La Weight Loss center for 4 years until I married last year. Yes LAWL does work but so do alot of other programs. The key with LAWL is Lifestyle change!!! You must be willing to make lifelong changes not temporary ones and the program will work. Let me see what tips I can give you.... Write down everything you eat, this sucks, but truly helps and this is a big part of LA program. Also eat often and never forget breakfast. Watch portions- especially starches and certain proteins. Eat veggies and fruits everyday. Stay away from processed foods, carry water with you everywhere and stop eating 2 hours before bedtime. Good luck and stay positive.!

Atlanta was supposed to host it in the '04-'05 season but I believe that they're hosting it in 2008 now. Phoenix was supposed to host it this year ('05-'06) but it was cancelled due to the Winter Olympics (which I wasn't happy about because I live in Phoenix). Comissioner Gary Bettman said that they will host it in several years. Dallas is hosting it next year.
It depends on the industry you're talking about. \n\nSome industry measure supplier performace using random QA whereby they grade the supplier by taking sample of the products for random testing. \n\nFor some just-in-time manufacturing plants, suppliers are graded based on the ability of the supplier to maintain a near to zero inventory while providing a consistent supply.

My advice is to quickly go to a doctor for this. This is something you don't want to just wait around to see if it goes away. With all the medical things that can go wrong in that spot, I would seek medical attention right away.
in order for your contacts to work....\n\nwe need to pay attention to this line:\n\n<form id="contact" action="" method="post" onsubmit="return configForm(this);" style="position: relative; z-index: 1;">\n\nYour form does not have the configForm() function neither do you import any javascript files so "return configForm()" is not really necessary....\n\nYour action=""....\nWhen you click the submit button of an HTML form... The form's action attribute defines the name of the file to send the content to. The file defined in the action attribute usually does something with the received input. It is normally a server side script e.g. asp, php, perl, etc which processes the users details.\n\nWhether or not you can use a server side scripting language depends on your host. Since you are hosting with yahoo... you might need to check your whether your hosting package allows. Another method is to make the form submit to an email addres but this normally opens the site visitors email client so it is not desirable. check out:\n\nhttp://w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp\nhttp://w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_mail\n\nPS: I like your site design...

The face and body of the Oriental people result from adaptations to the bitter cold. The body, and particularly the head, tends to be round, increasing body volume. The evaporative surface area of the skin is thus reduced relative to body volume, and less heat is lost. The nose is small and less likely to freeze, and the nostrils are narrow, warming the air before it reaches the lungs. Eyes are protected from the cold air by fatty folds of skin. Racial differences also result from the particular tastes of individuals via sexual selection.\n\nThe reason why white people don't have slanted eyes is because they probably evolved in a warmer climate, more like modern day Germany or Michigan in the US, which had cold winters and warm to hot summers, hence they didn't need protection from the year round severely cold climate/elements. It would also explain their comparatively more linear body structure. The climate they evolved in was probably a rainy one without a ton of sunlight, and they also must have lacked a significant source of vitamin D to consume and so they evolved lighter coloring to absorb more Vitamin D during the long Spring, Winter and Autumn months.

We didn't evolve from monkies... Humans and Monkies/Apes... Evolved from a common ancestor... Its a bit more complex then how I am putting it but trying to give the general idea... Our common ancestor given different enviromental conditions and different places it was located had different traits that the enviroment selected for... Some died... some lived... over time we get a number of different species, us being one, monkies and apes being other forms...

Yes, real estate investors like myself can and do work. But don't think it is a free ride. In most cases, you can save your credit, but you most likely will lose the house.\n\nSo, you have to ask yourself what is more important? Depending on the state you live in, foreclosure can be done in 4-6 weeks. So, you have to get your head out of the sand and come to grips that a train is coming at you.\n\nIf you are in a state that takes longer, you should seriously think about selling even at a reduced price. Some money is better than none.\n\nHave you talked with your mortgage company? If your circumstances have changed and you are now able to pay the monthly note, they may restructure and put the payments on the back end of the loan.\n\nWhere are you located?

Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes. Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia. Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nThere are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:\n\nSubclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic) \nSubclass Lepospondyli \nOf the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:\n\nOrder Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species \nOrder Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 552 species \nOrder Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 171 species \nAuthorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

Mithra was an ancient Persian god, who became a major deity of Zoroastrianism. He is cognate with the Hindu god Mitra.\n\nThe Persian Mithra apparently was the prototype for the Roman god Mithras, which became the object of a popular mystery religion in the Roman Empire; see Mithraism.\n\nThe Apollo asteroid 4486 Mithra was named after this Persian god.

Excessive flatulence is a sign of a food allergy/intollerance. The most common food allergies are caused by Dairy, Wheat flour and most other refined flours. (corn flour is usually safe, so is potato) Excessive fiber can cause such disturbances, however most people don't eat ENOUGH fiber, so that's unlikely to be the issue unless you happen to eat A LOT of it all the time. Beans are famous for their gaseous effects..but to be honest, I don't think beans are a real "gasser" for most people unless you happen to have a food allergy with beans. Cut the wheat, flour, and dairy from your diet for 3 days- I can almost guarrantee your flatulence will be diminished. I fart only about once a day! LOL Seriously, my diet is extremlely healthy and happens to be high in fiber (but not TOO high) instead of bread I eat brown rice, sweet potatoes, ect. Tortilla chips & anything made out of corn flour doesn't seem to bother me one bit. I also noticed a reduction in acne when I started doing this. Try it and see! Better than having to constantly down Beano all day!
sounds about right, maybe just a LITTLE too harsh, but I think the punishment should be something like that. the 10 PM curfew and any alcohol in the house and you go to jail parts are a little tough. However if he does have a family to suport he needs to learn to NEVER drink and drive this punishment is better for his family then having him dead in a car crash because the punishment wasn't harsh enough. What about the other guy in the car crash? He might have a family too.

Cajuns are people who are of the "Acadia" French living in Novia Scotia (Canada) that resettled in South Louisiana. They were entirely Catholic and came to escape religious persecution under Protestant England's rule 1800s. They take their culture very seriously and live in the area called ACADIANA stretching from Lake Charles to New Orleans on Interstate 10. They are known for festivals, famous cuisine, warm hospitality, broken accents, laid back attitude, and Acadian architecture. The X-generation was the last to have French everyday in public schools through 7th grade. French remains the first language spoken by all prior to the Baby Boomers. Almost every little town has its own unique community and people feel a sense of pride in continuing the tradition for generations. People have common last names like Hebert, Billeaud, Guidry, Comeaux, Bergeron, and pages of each exist in the phone books.

There is nothing outside of the Catholic Church to state he was a pope. All evidence shows he visited Rome, but he did not stay there, for one thing. Another... and this is a big one.... how is it that Priests are not allowed to marry, yet Peter, this supposed first pope, was indeed married????????? Seems to me it's contradictory in that alone and knocks out most other "evidence" the Church supplies to show he was Pope. That and the fact that the term Pope was a Pagan title during that time... and usually meant "Father"... as in a wise man who guided others on spiritual matters... though NEVER claimed to be infallible. Merely a helper.\n\nA little bit of study into this will show anyone these things. And it's all historical evidence outside of what the Church states as historical. I have a hard time believing that any church or any other particular group has the Truth while everything else in the world shows something different. Not everyone is out to lie when they write about history.

SCIENCEISFUN is correct\nChart Datum is referential information that describes in some cases how data on the chart was derived.\nA map with LAT/LONG lines on it must always have the projection i.e. NAD84, NAD27, polyconic etc, to indicate how the map was computed.\nLikewise, a map with elevations on it should indicate somewhere what they used for their 0.00 reference point, whether it be Mean Sea Level used by NGS or some other more local vertical control point.

Thoreau left the woods because he felt like he spent too much time lamenting the world's problems and not enough fixing them.\n\nBackground info: Emerson was Thoureau's hero. Emerson taught everything that Thoreau believed (mainly Transcendentalism and a mix b/w anarchy and true communism-not Chinese communism). However, Thoureau discovered that Emerson was a hipocrite- he didn't practice what he preached- and he (Thoreau) decided that he didn't want to be known as a hipocrite. Unfortunately, Thoureau's circle of influence was much smaller than Emerson's, so he didn't do a whole lot to change the world. \n\nThoreou wanted to live in the woods because he wanted to live "deliberately" and simply. Here is a quote from his essay "Where I Lived and What I Lived For" :\n "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."\n\nI hope this helped- I'm studying Thoreau right now too- so I'm not exactly an expert, you should try reading "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail"- it will either make things clearer for you, or confuse you even more.

that depends. does anyone in your family have diabetes or hypoglycemia? true hypoglycemia is rare. more often then not people abuse thier bodies by eating crap and then get surprised when their blood sugar crashes after eating that crap. or people go without eating for extended periods understress and they crash and also assume its hypoglycemia. any and all hypoglycemia is diet controled. usually having a piece of fruit or some other high fiber low gi food every hour prevents me from getting the shakes. if i get the shakes its not very long until i go into shock if i dont have something to increase my blood sugar. my grandfather has diabetes and i inhereted hypoglycemia from him. if you suspect you are hypoglycemic go to your doctor. they can find out for sure.
Cute. You want us to do your homework for your, and you provide a 4 word description of the problem.

You mean she's a junior and you're a sophmore right? If you're only a year apart then go for it! Just try asking her out as a friend first then let it go from there, good luck.
I myself am a life long Suns fan. Just the other day I was asking my friends if the Suns were cursed. It sure seems like it sometimes. But I honestly beleive that if we keep most of the team together over the off season that next year we have a real good chance at winning the title.
Is this spelled correctly? I am not finding anything.

Here are some Blonde Jokes for you !

Your dog is probably testing you. You have to show him/her that you are the master, not him/her. Male dogs are more likely to be unruly. To train him to do as you want, give him a slight tug on the leash when he does not respond properly and tell him no--a slight tug not a jerk. Also give him encouragement when he does well--a treat and a good boy or good girl.
I agree as well. You should list all of them. Employers want to understand your progression. If those job are irrelevant to what you are applying for then just put the dates, job title or function, and city, state. That should be enough to erase any initial doubts about what you did in life before that. But be prepared to answer any questions about those roles and if they have any bearing on your abilities as an employee or how they shaped you as a person.

English is already the national language of the United States. Learn it if you want to live here. I'm personally sick of seeing my country forsake its own culture so that every whining immigrant that enters can have a say just because they think they deserve one. Don't give me that crap about this country being started by immigrants, that was plenty long ago for it to have no bearing these days. Either live here as an American, speak our language and do as Americans do, or pack your belongings and get the hell out!
no not really but its a good movie and its a step and Indian movies changing their concepts so its something positive

If you find him attractive and you want to get to know more about him, Call him but make sure you make it completely slear that your not always going to make the first move and find out why he got your number if he wasnt going to use it? most likely he'll say something like he wasnt sure if you were feeling him and left the ball in your court... be alittle agressive and make that first move adn let him make all the next.
I sure hope not. I have met her. She is a mean, b.i.t.c.h. who absolutely HATES America and everything done in the past to secure the freedoms here. She despises the military. She does everything in her power to make sure that America becomes a third world country. She's a globalist. GOD help us if she ever gets to the oval office ever again.
No, of course not! For those of us who are American citizens, this is our inheritance. We have been born into an astonishing country, with astonishing values. And it is our job, as citizens, to help keep alive in whatever small way we can, because, like any inheritance, it can be squandered. And the only thing that will keep it intact is if we, who have been lucky enough to inherit it, try to keep faith with those who bequeathed it to us, and do our best to preserve and enhance it for those who come after us. I love America.

Blood tests will not show imminent heart attack. High cholesterol readings put one at risk, but not imminently. There are symptoms that can foreshadow a heart attack, however. These are most often bouts of fleeting chest pain or chest pressure associated with some shortness of breath. They can occur with increased frequency and severity over period of weeks to give one a warning. On the other hand, many heart attacks are sudden and without warning. There are stress tests to perform in order to see whether the arteries are blocked and high risk of heart attack exists. Talk to your doctor about these.

Unless the fire truck is told otherwise, it should go to the fire that it was originally sent to. The dispatcher will have a much better picture of what resources are available to fight both fires and they should make the decisions on which truck to send to which fire.\n\nLike with any emergency service, the situation can change from minute to minute. The fire truck should radio the dispatcher and inform them of the new fire. The dispatcher might already have another fire truck on the way or they might redirect the truck to the recently observed fire.\n\nYou also have to consider the type of fire involved. A fire at a hospital full of patients will have higher priority than a fire an an empty warehouse. Each case is different.

Propoganda plays on human emotions with bias, persuasion of thought, and with with-holding certain information (which links back to bias).

We will always pay more, no matter who has the oil. What a cynical ploy for a very cynical puppet figure.

I found this on the IMDB message board about this movie.\n\n"The character of the killer was inspired by the true story of the serial killer with possibly the record amount of killings, Pedro Alonso Lopez, "El Monstruo de los Andes" (monster of the Andes), who raped and murdered between 310 - 500 girls between Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. \n\nLopez, a Colombian, was once captured in Peru by the cops. The natives of a town approached him when he was suspiciously talking to a young girl. He was captured and tortured by the natives for several hours, and he was about to be burned alive when a protestant missionary saved him. The cops intervened at that point and arrested him, but they did not believe the reports of the natives, and deported him to Ecuador. \n\nThe discovery of a mass grave after a flood in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1980 quickly led to his arrest. A confession was extracted out of him by making a priest pretend that he was a fellow inmate and join him in his cell. In one day of talking Lopez calmly confessed to all his murders. He later led investigators to the gravesites of several of his victims (53 just in the first gravesite). He currently serves a life sentence in Ecuador. "

Yes...if a player is injured during his at bat (ie: fouling a ball off of his body resulting in broken bones or getting a major muscle strain where he just can't swing/stand the pain) It happened to Jermaine Dye when he was with Oakland. They were playing the Yankees at Yankee Stadium and he fouled a ball off of his leg and shattered the bone below the knee. Dye was carried off of the field by 2 players. The batter who replaced him inherited his count. I think it may have been a playoff game and El Duque was pitching (not positive about this).

The above answer is partially correct. I suspect you're looking to get spin on a full wedge shot, or possibly some short wedge shots around the green? \n\nBasically you need to realize that most golfers don't play on courses that are mowed with tight enough fairways to get clean enough contact for as much spin as you see the pro's get on TV....they play on fairways that are like our greens. \n\nYou need to have a clean clubface contact with the ball, NO grass in between the ball and clubface. The club must strike the ball at a decending angle of attack (easier with a wedge). \n\nIt's easier to get spin on knockdown type shots....instead of hitting a full sandwedge from 100 yards try hitting a 3/4 pitching wedge or nine iron, you might have more success in getting some spin if the ball comes in lower.....it'll hop once and then stop....

so a "normal" bp is 120/80, however, like body temp, peoples blood pressure runs differently. If you can function normally, without dizziness, fainting then your blood pressure is "normal" for you. are you athletic? people who are athletic usually have lower bps than those who are not. Was your bp extremely high before? I think you are just fine, and I would have your bp monitored at regular doctor visits, or if you start to feel faint and dizzy

Hi,\n\nTo be honest, you are probably not going to find a job working from home. Most of what you are going to find are scams where you will be asked to pay money and receive a list of places you can contact to apply to work online.\n\nI receive an RSS feed of all questions from Yahoo Answers that mention the terms "Job Search", "job Find" or "Job Seek". Most of the questions I see ask about online jobs. I have not seen one that said they were working at home.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about job searches is that you should use a combination of methods regardless of your location.\n\nNetworking - Register at your local Unemployment Office (you don't need to be on unemployment to register for their assistance). They often will have networking groups on a regular basis. They also are a good source for the jobs that never show up in the paper or online.\n\nCheck your local paper -- In many cases the paper's classified are now online.\n\nSearch Smart Online -- If you don't have a lot of time, spend most of your time at sites that aggregate the job feeds from several job search engines. Prominently these include indeed.com and thingamajob.com.\n\nOrganization -- I am the lead developer of a free online application that allows you to track your ads, jobs you apply for, send or print mail merged correspondence, and track your job search history. This site is jobsearchlog.com\n\nGood Luck,\n\nMichael\nSource(s):\n\nhttp://indeed.com\nhttp://thingamajob.com\nhttp://jobsearchlog.com

Hi! I am presently a medico on my way to become a doctor. Hope this helps. When u hav a goal of becoming a good doctor remember, that a dedicated doctor doesnot have a life of his own. All the pains u take in the process of becoming 1 is all worth just to have the job satisfaction & the respect in the society. People consider u next to God. What else would u want. Personally I consider the doctor's job next to a soldier's job in nobility. Well about the experiences u hav to bear a lot of odour while dissecting the preserved bodies, blood in surgeries & autopsies. All becomes secondary to the respect & love gained at the end of the race.
I would say no. There is nothing wrong with asking for help when you need it, as far as I'm concerned. However, if God is putting a different conviction on YOUR heart, that is a different story. Darling, I will pray for you to receive wisdom in your decision. My best suggestion is for you and hubby to pray together and seperately about it. Search the Word, ask God to give you an answer to your problem. Don't forget, as a Christian, anything that is on your heart is also on His. Only He can tell you what He wants you to do.

The Mandan Indians hunted buffalo and other game. They used wolf, buffalo and deer hide for clothes. Their diet consisted of buffalo meat, and deer meat. They also farmed the land, growing corn and beans for food. They also grew tobbacco.\n\nSemi-nomadic plains tribes who spent most of the year following the buffalo herds came to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages for corn, beans and squash to supplement their diet. They traded furs, most notably buffalo hides, for the vegetables.\n\nAgriculture was the economic foundation of the Knife River people, who harvested much of their food from rich floodplain gardens. The land was controlled by women-the size of a family's plot was determined by the number of women who could work it-and passed through the female line. They raised squash, pumpkin, beans, sunflowers, and, most importantly, tough, quick-maturing varieties of corn that thrived in the meager rainfall and short growing season. Summer's first corn was celebrated in the Green Corn ceremony. Berries, roots, and fish supplemented their diet. Upland hunting provided buffalo meat, hides, bones, and sinew.
Anywhere from 45-55 is normal, but in some rare cases it can start as early as the mid thirties. You should check with your OB to be sure it isn't stress, diet, excersise, or weight related.

Check the BBC website www.bbc.co.uk .\nSome of their productions do get on DVDs and in shops, althogh I believe you can mail order most BBC programs through their shop. Whatchout for repeats too, maybe you can get one in BBC 3 or 4 one of these days and ever record it.

There are two different types of life insurance\n1) Insurance with savings included in the package (known as cash value life insurance). These types of policies are also knowned as Whole Life, Universal Life, or Variable Life (or mixture of those words). They are always expensive because you are paying for two things (insurance and savings). Rate of return on savings are very low. In the first 3 years of the policy, no savings are accumulated. After 3 years, cash value starts to accumulate and you can borrow it anytime and pay it back with interest. If you borrow any cash value for whatever reasons, and you die without paying it back, this amount will be deducted from your face amount. Upon your death, all cash value will be kept by the insurance company. (All this info is stated in every cash value life policy).\n\n2) Regular insurance such as car insurance (known as Term insurance). These policies are known as "pure insurance." They are inexpensive, therefore you can get lots of coverage for a period of time. Since it is inexpensive, it gives you room to invest your money in the market (such as mutual funds). When investing, you should invest in the long term. No matter how the market performs, you should always continue to invest and don't pull out when the market does badly. Depending on how much you invest, you may not need life insurance or not as much coverage in 20 or 30 years. By that time, you should have less financial obligations to pay such as child support, college education, credit card debts, and mortgage. If you are still considering life insurance in 20 to 30 years, you should seek to lower your coverage because of your lower financial obligations than you have now.\n\nI personally own Primerica Life insurance. I bought a 30 year Term with $250,000 coverage. I pay approximately $35/month for it. I also invest $100/month into mutual funds. I'm hoping in 30 years, my mutual fund value is bigger than my life coverage by then. If I were to buy whole life insurance from Metlife, it would of cost me at least $200/month. So which company is good in NY? I would have to say Primerica. Even though I live in NJ, we're close enough.
Its sad to me that there are so many selfish people out there thinking that having a child is the answer to fixing there lagging relationship.... She is already selfish thinking only of her self, not the poor innocent baby, not caring about the guy who is clueless to her sheaming, and not caring about the consequences of him as well. WOW.. Tell your friend to get her head out of her ass, get a little dignity and respect for herself before she tries to provide that to a child.....Tell HIM NOW!!!

It's not only in European leagues, it's all over the world. Racism is not limited to soccer, it is in everyday life. I can't stand it. You can take a child from each 205 countries that started qualification for the cup, put them in a sandbox and the only fight you would have would be "he stole my shovel". Kids don't care what color people are. They know there is a difference but racism is a learned thing and when adults quit teaching it, racism will be no more.
Yes. If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired. Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
are you married to a US citizen? if you are then let him/her petition your child. other than that you have to wait til you get your green card and petition hiim/her as an IR2. go towww.uscis.gov about it.
Well your body stores fat in certain areas before others due primarily to genetics. That's partially why you can see similarities among family members' body types, regardless of whether they are overweight or not. Men do tend to store fat in the belly region first, and something interesting is that women usually lose fat in their breasts before anywhere else. I'm sure you look fine - have fun working out!
And if you eat it, you will die~nothing :)

Our heart is myogenic. That is it can beat on its own. If you take out your heart and put it in a solution with the right concentration of sodium, potassium and calcium, it can still beat. This is because, there are a group of cells known as the pacemakers in the SAN,AVN and Purkinjie fibres. They auto depolarise and start an electtrical impulse that travels down a certain pathway so that the 2 atria contracts before the 2 ventricles. \n\nHowever the rate of heart beat is controlled by the medulla of the brain. It either speeds up (sympathetic) or slows down (parasympathetic via vagus and glossopharyngeal) depending on the needs of the body.
Giants are much improved on defense and if they get Arrington they'll even be better the game will also be home for them in the Meadowlands.

Nobody is going to write a program to spec on Yahoo Answers for you. You can expect to use this site to get answers to a line of code you can't get to work. But you can't expect to use it to get people to write to a specification for you.\n\nFor that, you'll either have to learn to code in C++ and do it yourself, or you will have to hire a programmer, give him or her your specification, and pay him or her.

They aren't giving you a hard time. They have specific requirements that are probably spelled out in many of their publications and everyone applying for a license/photo ID needs to abide by the same rules. Do you have a Voter Registration card? Are you 18 at least? Register to vote. It's a free process and you sign your card and it is proof of residency. You can pick up a Voter Registration application at most US Post Offices, libraries, or contact the voter registration office in your town.\n\nYou might think about applying for a US Passport. You submit your passport application along with a copy of your birth certificate and 2 identical photographs. A passport is a very valid form of ID and can give you that proof you need to get other forms of ID. You will need 2 forms of ID when you are hired for jobs in the US, too. Last time I had my passport renewed it was about $50 and it is good for 10 years but it can be used for ID even after it expires. \n\nYou can pick up a passport application at many Post Office locations, or the process is probably available online by now.

I lived there for 16 years, moved Back to TX last year.\n\nFirst, I cannot imagine what you are comparing rental prices to, but they are not low in Las Vegas.\nHouses to buy, whether new construction or existing houses are also VERY expensive. We moved because we sold our 1953 (year built) house in a very nice but modest neighborhood, mostly hispanic, for three times what we paid for it. It was very close to downtown and close to the concentration of those elements you don't like. These houses are the lowest priced available and for many are in an undesireable location. When we sold, our house at very near 200,000 dollars was as cheap as you could buy a decent house of 1200 sq ft any where in the city. Anything costing less would be a destroyed house with crack squatters living in it.\n\nAs far as living there, the culture is very different and employers have NO employee regard. The reason is because there are plenty of people anxious to take your job if you don't like something. \n\nIf you can let all this roll off you, and we could, living there is fun. You can have a real good time just people watching on the strip or downtown. You must use good judgement if you are g oing to gamble, set your limit and stick to it! Remember you are not going to get rich gambling. We called the sale of our house our jackpot!\n\nThere are many fun things t o do around Las Vegas, Lake Meade, Mt Charleston, you are very near Zion National Park in Utah, very near California, 5hours to LA, \n\nOut in the suburbs life for your children would be fairly normal if you can afford to buy or rent there, check out Green Valley, for starters.\n\nIf you go there, the best to you, enjoy it and keep your good judgement!\n\n\nYou may e-mail me if you have more specific questions.
I do not know whether this is typical or not, but here goes ...\n\nQuestion: There are 5 gecko lizards together on the ceiling. One lizard tells the others, "Hey guys, watch this!" He then does a backflip and falls on the floor. How many lizards are there on the ceiling?\nAnswer: 0. The other 4 fell down when they lifted their forelegs to clap.
There is no good way to tell. You have to always be careful not to say anything that you would get in some kind of trouble for.

haha...its #2. But ok. There is this thing you can buy.. it is call Kefir...if you have an HEB where you live, I know you can find it there. It is a yogurt type drink that has active bacteria cultures that aid in your digestive tract.. and help things run more smoothly. Drink prune juice...that may help. Also, look for a really good health food store...there are things that you can buy that help replace/ad the proper bacteria and such that you need in your colon. I know there is a form of it that comes in powder. You really have to search, and see what you can find in the natural foods/supplements area, especially if the doctors aren't going to help.\nGood luck.\n:)

drifting is stupid.. all show, why drift when you could actually take a tighter corner with a sweet car like an F1
Centriptal Force\n\nAny motion in a curved path represents accelerated motion, and requires a force directed toward the center of curvature of the path. This force is called the centripetal force which means "center seeking" force. The force has the magnitude\n\nSwinging a mass on a string requires string tension, and the mass will travel off in a tangential straight line if the string breaks.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration can be derived for the case of circular motion since the curved path at any point can be extended to a circle.\n\nNote that the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the velocity, implying that a doubling of speed will require four times the centripetal force to keep the motion in a circle. If the centripetal force must be provided by friction alone on a curve, an increase in speed could lead to an unexpected skid if friction is insufficient.

Depends if you are asking about carpets or actual steam cleaning as used in industry. Since you didn't say which I will answer both.\n\n1. Carpets. Does not use steam but very hot water mixed with a solvent or detergent. It uses pressure to make sure the solution penetrates deep and then vacuums the solution and removed dirt and hopefully grease into a holding tank for disposal. A much cheaper and slightly more effective mixture than commercial cleaning fluids is real lemon juice. The various acids naturally in lemon are a very effective grease cutter and also act as a fabric brightner. Use the same amount as you would commericial cleaner. (It can be used pure in a squirt bottle to degrease a dirty engine. Spray on wait (the time it takes to spray should be long enough) and rinse or spray off. I suggest spraying off with the same bottle. That you won't get the wires wet and need to wait before starting the car.\n\n2. Industry. Actually does steam and requires the user to wear a heat and waterproof suit. The high temperature and presurre very effectively removes dirt and grease. Usually it is used on machines heavily caked with grease.\n\nHope this helps
Need more context, please.\n\nBest guess, it may have to do whether the name of the defendant is spelled the same on the summons and on the complaint, and whether it is spelled correctly. \n\nLet's say you are suing a large hamburger chain and named it "MacDonald's" in your complaint, when the true name is "McDonald's". McDonald's is likely to just file an answer and note the mistake.
If the insured person has collision coverage, their insurance company will pay, exluding the deductible. If they were at fault, it stops there. And their premium will go up. If they were not at fault, the company will pay and try to go after the uninsured person. (Good luck.)\n\nIf the insured person has "uninsured driver" insurance, the company will pay any liability costs. I'm not sure if being at fault comes into play here.
The Meisenberg Universitat ran a 15 year program on 7500 pregnant women and their babies between 1957 and 1972 (using findings reported by Dr. Joseph Mengela from his experiments at the Oswieczim Klinische in 1944-45). The chief physicians involved were Drs. Heinrich Schimmelmann (a clinical obstetrician), Gertruda Greundfeld (a clinical psychologist) and Magda Zhitanska (a clinical pediatrician and para psychologist). The team was headed by Dr. Mikhail Ivanovich Strovankiev (psychiatrist and mathematician) until he retired in 1964 and was replaced by Dr. Gunther Romanovich (psychiatric pediatrician).\n\nThey concluded from their experiments that the children exposed to Bach and Mozart for at least 5 continuous hours twice weekly during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first 2 years of life were about 25% faster in learning mathematics at the ages of 7 - 14. Because the study ended, there was apparently no follow-up to determine whether or not the trend continued at later ages. \n \nThose children likewise exposed to Italian opera were on par with the children not exposed to music at all, while the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian folk music were about 10% ahead on the learning curve. Rock and Roll resulted in about a 5% decline in math skills, but a 15% increase in language abilities, both in German and foreign languages.\n\nSchimmelmann, Greunfeld and Zhitansku postulated that the increased mathematical skills derives from the meticulous mathematical construct of Bach and Mozart, while the more whimsical lyrical quality of the Italian operas did not engender the mathematical focus of the German selections. (This may be a conclusion based more on propaganda than actual scientific results.) They also attributed the increased math learning by the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian Folk music on the less intricate but inherent mathematical foundation of these forms of music, while concluding that the less mathematical but more free-flowing and innovative rhythms in Rock enhanced the artistic and imaginative characteristics of subjects, making them receptive to understanding language better, but less able to work problems in math and logic.\n\nThe experiment was a joint effort sponsored by the East German and Soviet governments, in conjunction with related research into para psychological phenomena. The para psychological components of the study have been largely ignored, but the study did report increased psychic abilities in the children exposed to Rock, which follows from the conclusions reached as mentioned above.\n\nThe study was reported in the July 19, 1976, edition of Pravda and mentioned in the January 24, 1977, edition of Die Zeitung. It was largely discounted by the Western scientific community at the time. To my knowledge, the actual study has never been published in the West and Western criticism was without benefit of reviewing the research.\n\nI became aware of the study while enrolled at Julliard in 1978, but was unable to procure a copy of the study beyond that reported in Pravda and Die Zeitung. I was so intrigued by the articles that I have retained my notes on them, but unfortunately cannot locate the actual articles. Sorry. \n\nIf you find anything further on the study, particularly about any follow-up study which may have been done, please post it here. I had forgotten about the whole affair until reading your question.

Dude, you sound like you may have Asperger's Syndrome. One of the symptoms of Aspergers is asexuality or at least a low sex drive.\n\nHere is an online test that you can take to find out:\nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html\n\nBut there are a lot more symptoms as well. Take the test and see if it says you are one. If so, read up on aspergers and see if you have any of the other symptoms.
I am a registered nurse, so I'll help you here. A nurse gives you the injection (and you should have had a "wheal" that looks like a mosquito bite). You have 48-72 hours and then it must be "read". All that means is that the nurse is checking for what's called induration, or redness AND swelling. If there is any swelling that you can feel, then she/he should measure this diameter in mm. Anything above 10mm indicates a positive TB test, and referral for a chest x-ray. That basically means that you carry the tuberculosis infection in your blood due to exposure previously, or you have an active case of TB. \n\nThe nurse is allowed to check this legally, because it is like a lab result. A doctor is not usually involved with TB skin tests unless there's a positive reaction as described above. I administer TB tests everyday in my job, and I SELDOM have anything that is above a 3mm, which is negative.

To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a "developing" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector.

yes. but everything in moderation. as a gamer it's nice to see yourself progressing through the game, achieving good scores or passing levels things like that. but one can become WAY too wrapped up in it and forget that the real world exists too. games often promote critical thinking, problem solving skills, dexterity and not to mention determination. even the "bad" games like GTA or HALO promote quick reflexes, sharp thinking and lots of determination. just the opposite could also be said for games how they rot ones mind or make people lose their grip on reality. but those people are called losers and emos I believe. as long as things are kept in moderation then everyinthg is cool.

Daunte's recovery is in question. When he was having his fued with the Vikings before the trade, the guy was rehabbing knee at a physical therapist in a strip mall in Florida!!! This guy is worth untold millions to the team and he wouldn't come to Minnesota to work with the best therapists in the world...it doesn't add up. And even if he is healthy, you'd better hope Joey beats him out to start. Daunte is not the QB Big Manning or McNabb is because he just doesn't read defenses well enough to fully exploit an opponent. It's widely known that when Cris Carter retired and couldn't help Daunte in the huddle, his numbers dropped off dramatically. Joey, I think, has all the talent in the world and with Saban, who is way more structured than Mooch ever was, is the kind of guy who can lead younger players. Joey is their best bet to win.\nRicky Williams was suspended for violating the drug policy...again...he will play in Canada this year as permitted by Saban. If they keep him, they need him in shape and if they trade him, they need on the filed performance to offset the drug tests so Nick had no choice but to let him play.

The only PERFECT vintage Bowden I have ever seen is at the Smithsonian on loan from the owner. The value of such an item is going to be hard to pin down but perhaps you can do an online search.\n\nStrangely, the Spacelander was designed about 1946 in aluminum but not placed into production until 1960, so if he has the original 1951 fiberglas prototype it's value is inestimable. A mint 1960 version has seen pricing in the $10,000 to $12,000 range.\n\nThe Spacelander, as you probably already know, was reproduced in the 1990s, and I think they are still available today, these can be had for less than a couple of thousand dollars.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing bicycles, even the smallest imperfection detracts from value unless the bike is hopelessly rare (the Spacelander may fall into this category).

This is not your fault. Better communication about likes and dislikes helps, but ultimately, it's up to the female. It's always beeen sociaaly acceptable for a guy to have and enjoy sex. It's not so much with the female. Our body image, past trauma, fear of being caught, inability to REALLY let loose and enjoy the act, etc. can hinder any possibility of orgasm.\nPersonally, i couldn't if I am not in love with a guy. It's true. the berst sex for me is with the man (my man) I am head over heels for. I do have to say though, that I agree with the "getting her (close to) drunk".

I have. Been vacationing there since 2000 but visited it first around 1994. I simply love this country and everything about it. Feels like my second home. It's a wonderful mixture between oriental and occidental culture, lively, vivid and colorful, of course with the spicy mediterranean twist. The scenery is amazing, people are very friendly and talkative, always eager to help, food is excellent and there's plenty of places to visit (whether you're interested in the scenery, having fun, relaxing, culture and history, shopping...so on and so forth). Not to mention the mild mediterranean climate which i adore!\nSo yeah, i guess i could say it's nice and interesting...and beyond :)

Probably not if you're trying to do a scantron test or something that requires pencil lead to be processed. Also, not a good idea to sign a check or other important document with an erasable pen. Also, I don't think I'd use a paccer for drawing if you're trying to go for the pencil look.\n\nOther than that, I'd say it really is your preference.
who ever told you that non sense is a sorry piece of work. Prison is more horrible than you can imagine. Imagine being told when to urinate,eat,sleep, and being locked down 24 hrs a day in a 2 man cell which is smaller than two foot lockers ...Imagine eating bugs. Imagine getting your manhood or womanhood taken by a prison guard. Imagine loosing all of your belongings when you get out you have lost everything, family, house, pets. You now live on the streets after being treated like dirt. Now put this in your term paper. I am one of those prisoners that was wrongfully accused. Of course our justice system didn't work because of all the political bullshit. I did a year and let me tell you it is the worst nightmare you can imagine. Imagine screaming all night every night. Never sleeping. Terrible food. Fights all day. People crying, people getting rolled up out of bed because they are having seizures. In which they roll the people out in hallways on their stomachs until the seizure stops and they are drooling. They then roll them back into their to oms on their stomachs and leave them.

KNOW THE FACTS....ONE MORE THING RATS EAT YOUR FOOD AND CLOTHS TOO.\n\nIn a report for the United Nations' Committee against Torture, the London-based human rights group also alleged abuses within the U.S. domestic law enforcement system, including use of excessive force by police and degrading conditions of isolation for inmates in high security prisons.\n\n"Evidence continues to emerge of widespread torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of detainees held in U.S. custody," Amnesty said in its 47-page report. \n\nIt said that while Washington has sought to blame abuses that have recently come to light on "aberrant soldiers and lack of oversight", much ill-treatment stemmed from officially sanctioned interrogation procedures and techniques.\n\n"The U.S. government is not only failing to take steps to eradicate torture, it is actually creating a climate in which torture and other ill-treatment can flourish," said Amnesty International USA Senior Deputy Director-General Curt Goering.\n\nThe U.N. committee, whose experts carry out periodic reviews of countries signatory to the U.N. Convention against Torture, is scheduled to begin consideration of the United States on Friday. The last U.S. review was in 2000.\n\nIt said in November it was seeking U.S. answers to questions including whether Washington operated secret detention centers abroad and whether President George W. Bush had the power to absolve anyone from criminal responsibility in torture cases.\n\nThe committee also wanted to know whether a December 2004 memorandum from the U.S. Attorney General's office, reserving torture for "extreme" acts of cruelty, was compatible with the global convention barring all forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.\n\n\nUNTIL THE END \nIn its own submission to the committee, published late last year, Washington justified the holding of thousands of foreign terrorism suspects in detention centers abroad, including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, on the grounds that it was fighting a war that was still not over.\n\n"Like other wars, when they start, we do not know when they will end. Still, we may detain combatants until the end of the war," it said.\n\nThe U.S. human rights image has taken a battering abroad over a string of scandals involving the sexual and physical abuse of detainees held by American forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. \n\n\nIn its submission, Washington did not mention alleged secret detention centers.\n\nAmnesty listed a series of incidents in recent years involving torture of detainees in U.S. custody, noting the heaviest sentence given to perpetrators was five months in jail.\n\nThis was the same punishment you could get for stealing a bicycle in the United St

Morality can't be decided by popular opinion, because right is right and wrong is wrong.\n\nJust as we can't decide the sun should move west to east -- we think whatever we think, but that doesn't change reality.\n\nHarm is wrong. 'Cause suffering sucks.\n\nWhat people DO decide, sometimes sorta by popular opinion, are laws, which are another matter (it would be nice if law and morality were better matched).\n\nAlso, changes in the arbitrary aspects of ettiquette are determined by popular opinion.\n\nUntil whoever it was in a previous answer said it was a shame that rape is considered wrong (if I'm understanding that comment), that person had a pretty good handle on it.\n\nBut clearly rape, as a particularly devastating form of violence, is clearly wrong.\n\nBut the basic idea that morality has to do with what we are, the kind of critter we are, is right.\n\nThe problem with the 10 commandment is that several of them are arbitrary and even silly (most of the people who go on and on about them violate them every Sabbath by watching sports, for example), and the list as a whole leaves out a lot of things that are wrong.\n\nFor example, it's wrong to put another person in a double-bind or lose-lose situation, where no matter what they do they are hammered or punished.
I'm assuming you're not white, therefore you would be looked at in a very suss way by the authorities.

I usually celebrate holidays with my group, and then again alone. I find, sometimes, that the preparation for a solitary rite is sometimes just as meaningful as the celebration itself. I know how you feel. I used to feel that way many years ago. I put forth more effort for my family's holidays rather than my own. That's when I started coming up with special preperation for my own holidays and it made each one more special for me. Now I have 10+ year traditions for myself and I get really excited about them.\n\nFor example - Before Summer Solstice, I put the summer wreath on the door (make seasonal wreaths - it's a blast!), and then re-decorate my living room altar to honor the Gods of the sun and fire. I leave each altar up for a month or so. I'll change the altar depending on the meaning behind the celebration so it's always changing. I'll set aside time for long pre-ritual baths. I'll take the time to bake a cake. Take my time shopping for wine. Those sorts of things.

Industrial wastes cause pollution in four major areas: air, water, soil and atmosphere. Those wastes that are gaseous pollute air that living things breath or use for food production as in plants. Gaseous wastes in air will either kill living things or disturb their normal processes. Gaseous pollutants also pollute our atmosphere that the atmosphere will lose its ability of blanketing the earth from hostile rays coming from the sun and space. Acid rain is as well caused by gaseous wastes. Wastes also pollute water bodies and soil and result in killing or disturbing the normal processes of living things specially plants.

Following a 2000 lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund (also WWF), the Federation changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE. Its parent company, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, also chose to adopt this name. The lawsuit dealt with the wrestling company's breaching of an agreement with the Fund over use of the initials "WWF" in the United Kingdom. Rather than attempt a financial settlement with the Fund, McMahon changed the name of the company. The logo was altered, and a promotional campaign called "Get The F Out" was used to publicize this change. Also, all verbal and visual references to "WWF" and the World Wrestling Federation logo from the "Attitude" era were edited out from old broadcasts. Some observers saw the new name as further acknowledgement by the company on its emphasis towards the entertainment rather than athletic aspects of professional wrestling.

The Congress is made up of two parts, called houses. The Senate is the upper house and each state has 2 senators. The lower house of the Congress is the House of Representatives. It is larger than the Senate because the number of representatives from each state depends on the state's population and is not set at a specific number. Each house of Congress has varying responsibility and rights. So, in short, the Senate is just one half of the Congress.

On the positive side, it opens up avenues of information that would normally have been difficult to access in the past, as well as present materials in a way which may benefit those whose learning styles differ from traditional teaching methods.\n\nOn the negative side, it has a tendency to make teachers lazy, as they are often quite happy to let the computer (or whatever else they might be using) teach the class for them. It also makes some instructors less dynamic than they could be, as they are often sitting down in one spot of the class working the controls instead of interacting with their students.

What makes people drowsy from NyQuil is the 25% alcohol added to the antihistamines. It would take way more than 2 tablespoons to cause any toxicity in an otherwise healthy 10 year old. If he were to take a whole bottle at once, that could definitely be a problem and I would then advise calling your local poison control. He'll be fine, albeit very drowsy.

cause he's an alchoholic\n\nthe connection with corn liquor produced in the South, since corn is "cracked" before being mixed with other ingredients and fermented into alcohol. In the US, this industry is strongly associated with Southern states, especially the illegal "moonshine" corn whiskey that was produced secretly to avoid government taxation in the 1800s. On a recent visit to my parents, who live down in North Carolina, we visited a cultural museum where one of the featured exhibits was a still (the equipment for producing corn whiskey.) To the best of my knowledge, there are no stills in museums up here in Boston. Most sources that believe this to be the root of the word point to song The Blue Tail Fly (more popularly known as Jimmy Crack Corn) which tells the story of a slave who escapes punishment when his master is killed in a riding accident - even though it happened because he failed to keep flies from biting the master's nervous horse.

This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

This is the FIFA rule regarding your question. This rule came into force on 1 January 2004.\n\nUp his 21st birthday, a player who has represented an Association team (Country) in one or more matches of an official competition may henceforth request to change the Association for which he is eligible, provided that he fulfils the following criteria:\n\n- he has not played at “A” international level for the Association for which he is eligible at the time he submitted the request;- he had dual nationality (or more than two nationalities), at the time of his first appearance in an international match in an official competition of any category. Therefore, this provision does not apply to any players who have been naturalised after having already represented one Association. Consequently, FIFA has rejected the request submitted by Murat Mogomedov, a Russian player but now a naturalised Israeli, as he has already played for Russia.\n\nAny player who fulfils the above criteria may only once request to change the Association for which he is eligible.

Requests For Military Mailing Addresses\n\nResponsibility for military personnel records falls within the jurisdiction of the military departments, not the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Therefore, requests for military addresses should be sent to the respective service of the individual whose address is being sought. There is no comprehensive source for e-mail addresses. Even if there were, military regulations and the Privacy Act of 1974 do not permit the military departments to provide home addresses or telephone numbers of service personnel. Moreover, regulations do not permit random dissemination of listings of names and addresses of service personnel. These regulations have been established to protect individual service men and women from commercial exploitation and to respect their right of privacy. Because of the large volume of requests that each service locator receives, please allow four weeks processing time for written requests. \n\nSpecific information\n\nThe following information is needed for all requests for all locator services: \n\n\nGive as much identifying information as possible about the person you wish to locate such as full name, rank, last duty assignment/last known military address, service number, and Social Security number. \n\nThe locator service is free to immediate family members and government officials. Other family members, civilian friends, businesses and others must pay $3.50. The check or money order must be made out to the U.S. Treasury.

Are you referring to operating temperature of the engine?\n\nIt depends on where you are measuring it. Inside the cylinders, oil temperature, coolant temperatures...they're all different.\n\nSince most dashboard temperature gauges refer to coolant temperature, I will elaborate a little bit on that. Normal operating temperature for engine coolant is typically 180-195°F and is regulated by the coolant thermostat (usually a bimetallic controlled valve). Coolant can get up to about 240°F before serious problems begin to develop (such as boiling). This is because the coolant is not entirely water, and it is under slight pressure, which raises the boiling point of the coolant.

The debt does not only represent an increase in spending, it also represents a decrease in revenues. Since spending went up and revenues went down, you have an increasing federal deficit.\n\nThere has been a lot of money spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There have been tax breaks that have continued for large corporations including the Oil industry. There have been a huge increase in "earmarks" which are basically money Congress loots from the budget to give to people in their own districts.\n\nAs a registered Republican since 1979 I am distressed to see my party abandon fiscal responsibility and even more distressed that this burden will now fall onto my children and grandchildren.

FInd out exactly what ihe's into and give it to him, no matter how dumb or "uncool you think it is" His present should be about him. For example I have been married over 6 years and my husband still loves cartoon superheroes. I think it's so dumb, but for every holiday I get him toys and things with superheroes, and he loves it. If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed. So find out what your guy is into (maybe a sports team, hobby, character, etc) and go with that. If it's what he's intrested in, you can't go wrong no matter what you think of it.

time heals all wounds, its just too early to think about dating again. i dont think it's much about women vs men...both can hurt and feel pain just as much as the other. try to get ur mind off of things, spend time with ur kids to build a more solid relationship with them, ur parents, go out and have fun with ur friends...truth is that although u think no one cares for u, u will be leaving too many ppl in alot of pain, feeling guilt, feeling like u could have done so much more. life is a b*tch no matter how u see it. but u cant run away from it, u have to find ways to build up strength and a place where u know u can be someone in this world...even if its for 2 kids that supposedly dont care for u right now. dont give up...make it right for urself. God did not put u on this earth to take the easy way out, so dont focus on dating and finding someone else because u dont feel like anything else is worth living, try making what u have work for u...and think of how fortunate u are to have the little u have. work on ur life, u have so much and u dont even know it, somewhere...but u have to want to find it, and learn to appreciate how much ur place in the world is important to alot of ppl.
is there any difference created in the team selection or approach of BCCI towards game through our tips ? Then why should we think about it ? No doubt winning world cup is a matter of pride and honour for us and our country. But when the people sitting at top have no respect of our expectations, then what we can do. They are just happy with the politics. So there is no point in disussing this. And as far as world cup is concerned then forget @ India. It will be great if they could go ahead from even league matches. So now just stop supporting the team. This is my request to all of u. \nJust wasting 9 precious hours in watching India's match is foolishness now. Its @ wasting almost 600 hours (that is, more than 25 days) per year, if india plays 45-50 days cricket in an year !!!! Its difficult to stop ourselves but we need to do this, becoz there are many more important things in our life... Forget Chappel, Forget Dravid, Forget Ganguly.... and Forget Indian team... if u just remembers cricket any day then just watch highlight of Sachin's inning against Aussie at Sarjah of 1998. Entire cricket is in that inning.... Cricket is not more than that...\nSorry for being so emotional... but i m too much disturbed due to team's performance, strategies, and the main point, selection.
yes. the sex genes come from both parents, but since all females are XX, they can only contribute an X to the baby. Males are XY, so each sperm is either an X or Y and that determines the sex of the baby.

If you're considering this an investment, then I would steer you more towards two or more bedroom condos. The one bedroom condos are very sensitive to housing market fluctuations in that they are the first to suffer and very difficult to sell if the overall housing market declines.
Your friend won't be able to do anything with the bonds since they are registered in the deceased man. They would have to be re-registered and without any kind of supporting documentation, the registering agent wouldn't re-issue in your friends name.\n\nBest thing would be to perhaps find out from the newspaper who placed the estate ad, or maybe find out who ran the estate auction (if it was an auction).
that is still in the hands of the states.
I do know that it causes eye strain. I hear many people say that they wear glasses now because they have worked with computers for so long but, if the computers were the cause I don't know. I would suggest that you take many short breaks, (looking at something else or looking at a distance somewhere in the office or out a window), from staring at the CRT for so long and keep a comfortable distance while working with the CRT.

The longer a computer stays on, the longer it builds up dust inside, which can reduce cooling efficiency of the cooling fans. Heat buildup can destroy the electronic components, especially memory and the CPU. Cleaning the inside by vacuuming it out regularly will help.\n\nThe disk, assuming it doesn't do an auto powerdown, will have a shortened lifespan.\n\nMost modern monitors do go into sleep mode, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nStaying on all the time does, to a very small degree, age the circuitry.\n\nThere is a power savings in turning them off.\n\nI see little advantage to leaving it up 24/7, other than not waiting for bootup and shutdown.\n\nIf you have it connected to a surge suppressor strip, then turning off the strip, as well, provides some protection from lightening strikes. The strip itself can't handle a major voltage spike, like you will see from lightening. Of course, a modem would be an additional point of voltage spike with lightening, one the powerstrip won't help.\n\nThere will be a small amount of power going through part of the system when it's powered down, but still has power to the plug, but most of the circuitry will not be live.\n\nDisadvantages exist if you are connected to the internet 24/7. You would need a good firewall and virus protection software.
I dont really know what that pain could be. It definitely could be related to the PCOS. I would recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. It would probably be OK to wait until Jan...but when you make your appt., talk to a nurse and see what they say. Here's a little general info on PCOS that I feel is important. \n\n\n The underlying cause of PCOS is insulin resistance (IR). The best treatment for PCOS is going on an insulin sensitizing drug such as metformin (1500-2550mg per day) combined with a low carb diet and exercise. There are a few important things to know:\n\n1. Many women "pass" the test for IR, but still respond positively from the metformin. No one knows exactlly why..my thought is that the test is not a sure fire way of detecting the IR.\n\n2. You must be on a high enough dose of metformin. I've heard women complain that their bodies dont start working even though they've been on metformin for awhile. Some doctors are hesitant to up the dose past 1500mg...but for some of us it takes more. I don't respond until my dose is around 2000mg a day. \n\n3. It can take a few months on the correct dose, before your body is regulated. \n\n4. It is important to treat your PCOS even if you are not trying to get pregnant. There are higher risks for many things (high blood pressure, blood clots, diabetes, and many other things) when you have PCOS, but if it is treated properly, then those risks go back to a normal rate. \n\nI recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. They are the most knowledgeable about PCOS. I also highly recommend visiting http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhp... It is a great message board, where you can ask all your PCOS questions. The women there are great. Good luck.
your not asking for to much....lol
My Dear One, why someone would thumb's down this unoffensive question shows just what idiocy is. As for America's politics (I'm going to depart from my usual kindness to say...) it all goes into the same pot and say even though politicians say their party lines are different, they're really not. Politics really boils down to the sum of it's name; that being poli: (lat) meaning "many and tics : blood sucking parasites. Gone are the statesmen. We only have politicians. I give you a thumb's up for asking . Blessings.

I think this is one of the most ridiculous questions I have ever read. What are you going to do..have people fill out a form before they are ALLOWED to have children? This is stereotyping. Some children follow in their parents footsteps and some DON"T...You obviously dont get out much. Crimes are committed from folk from alll walks of life stupid. Do you not watch the news? Millionaires commit murders, people WITH money steal..Single parent homes dont usually start out that way...MOST times a loser decides they want out and leave and the single-parent MOSTLY women stay and hold it down as best as she can...I know cause I AM A SINGLE PARENT of 4 BOYS (7-18) None of my sones have been arrested for anything. My 18yr old son is going to college this year so dont talk to me about control. Did you not just see that Dana Reeves died of lung cancer and she was a non-smoker so what now? IDIOTIC people shouldnt be allowed to have kids and I hope you never do because ignorance kills ya loser.
Tech school is better, that way, when you discover that the computer field is dead like everyone else, you would have only wasted two years of your life and not four.

Gibbon\nGibbons are the small apes that are grouped in the family Hylobatidae. The family is divided into four genera based on their diploid chromosome number: Hylobates (44), Hoolock (38), Nomascus (52), and Symphalangus (50).[2][3] They occur in tropical and subtropical rainforests from northeast India to Indonesia and north to southern China, including the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and Java. The extinct Bunopithecus sericus is an extinct gibbon or gibbon-like ape which, until recently, was thought to be closely related to the Hoolock gibbons.[2]\n\nAlso called the lesser apes, gibbons differ from great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans) in being smaller, pair-bonded, in not making nests, and in certain anatomical details in which they superficially more closely resemble monkeys than the great apes do. Gibbons are masters of their primary mode of locomotion, brachiation, swinging from branch to branch distances of up to 15 m (50 ft), at speeds as much as 56 km/h (35 mph). They can also make leaps of up to 8 m (27 ft), and walk bipedally with their arms raised for balance.\n\nOne unique aspect of gibbon physiology is that the wrist is composed of a ball and socket joint, allowing for biaxial movement. This greatly reduces the amount of energy needed in the upper arm and torso, while also reducing stress on the shoulder joint. They also have long hands and feet, with a deep cleft between the first and second digits of their hands. Their fur is usually black, gray, or brownish, often with white markings on hands, feet, and face. Some species have an enlarged throat sac, which inflates and serves as a resonating chamber when the animals call. This structure is enormous in a few species, equalling the size of the animal's head.\n\nGibbon skulls resemble those of the great apes, with very short rostra, enlarged braincases, and large orbits that face forward. Gibbons have the typical nose of catarrhine primates with nostrils that are close together and face forward and slightly downward. They lack cheek pouches and their stomach is not sacculated. Their teeth also are similar to the great apes, with molars that are bunodont and lack lophs. The upper molars usually have a cingulum, which is sometimes large. The canines are prominent but not sexually dimorphic\n\nGibbons are social animals. Strongly territorial, gibbons defend their boundaries with vigorous visual and vocal displays. The vocal element, which can often be heard for long distances, consists of a duet between the mated pair, the young animals sometimes joining in. This eerie song can make them an easy find for poachers who engage in the illegal wildlife trade and in sales of body parts for use in traditional medicine.\n\nMost species are threatened or endangered, most importantly from degradation or loss of their forest habitat. Gibbon species include the Siamang, the White-handed or Lar Gibbon, and the Hoolock gibbons. The Siamang, which is the largest of the 13 species, is distinguished by having two fingers on each hand stuck together, hence the generic and species names Symphalangus and syndactylus.\n\nand\n\nBaboon\nThe baboons are some of the largest non-hominid members of the primate order; only the Mandrill and the Drill are larger. In modern scientific use, only members of the genus Papio are called baboons, but previously the closely related Gelada (genus Theropithecus) and two species of Mandrill and Drill (genus Mandrillus) were grouped in the same genus, and these monkeys are still often referred to as baboons in everyday speech. The word "baboon" comes from "babouin", the name given to them by the French naturalist Buffon. Papio belongs to family Cercopithecidae, in subfamily Cercopithecinae.\n\nPhysiology\nAll baboons have long dog-like muzzles (cynocephalus = dog-head), close-set eyes, heavy powerful jaws, thick fur except on their muzzle, a short tail and rough spots on their protruding hindquarters, called isch

Mosquitoes actually use CO2 to home in on a warm blood source. Once close enough they go for the radiant heat. Lucky for them or unlucky for us mammals and particularly human mammals are usually the highest producers of both CO2 and radiant heat in the areas we live.\n\nI and most I know have found "skin so soft" to be the most effective way to repel the mosquitoes.\n\nThe best way to deal with this problem now is much simpler if you normally use your back yard say for a party. There is a mosquito catcher that uses propane gas with a small flame to spread CO2 gas, the burner is quite large and surface temperature is just above the normal radiated temperature of humans so the mosquitoes that do live in your area are attracted to it and the little fan sucks them into a bag.\n\nAfter several uses (days in a row) you will have collected most of the mosquitoes in range of your back yard and things can be so pleasant.
God has promised us that the whole earth will soon become a paradise just as the garden of Eden once was.\nThese are God's promises regarding our earth and those who will live forever on it--\n\nISAIAH 11:6-9-- "And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea."\nPSALM 37:9-11--" For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."\nISAIAH 2:4--"And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."\nISAIAH 33:24--"And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity."\nMICAH 4:4--"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it."\nISAIAH 29:18---"And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness."\nISAIAH 35:5-6--" Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert." \n\nWhat blessed times we'll realize--if we keep our eyes on the prize (of everlasting life on a perfect world)

Winston Churchill, Political Leader / Writer / World War II Figure \n\nBorn: 30 November 1874 \nBirthplace: Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England \nDied: 24 January 1965 \nBest Known As: Indefatigable prime minister of Britain during World War II \nSoldier, politician and finally prime minister, Winston Churchill was one of Britain's greatest 20th-century heroes. Churchill fought with the British Army in India and Sudan, and as a journalist was captured in South Africa (where his dispatches from the Boer War first brought him to public prominence). He became a member of Parliament in 1900 and remained an MP for over 64 years. His early topsy-turvy political career earned him many enemies, but his stirring speeches, bulldog tenacity and his refusal to make peace with Adolf Hitler made him the popular choice to lead England through World War II. When Britain and its allies prevailed in 1945, Churchill's place in history was assured. (Ironically, he lost the prime ministership two months after Germany's surrender, when the opposition Labor Party took majority control of Parliament.) One of the 20th century's most quotable wits, Churchill wrote a plethora of histories, biographies and memoirs, including the landmark four-volume A History of the English-speaking Peoples (1956-58). In 1953 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; he was knighted the same year.\n\nChurchill served as prime minister from 1940-45 and again from 1951-55... His wartime contemporaries included presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin... More recent British PMs have included Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair... The famous portrait of a scowling Churchill was taken by Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh.\n\nBritish politician and writer. As prime minister (1940–1945 and 1951–1955) he led Great Britain through World War II. Churchill published several works, including The Second World War (1948–1953), and won the 1953 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nEarly Career\n\nEducated at Harrow and Sandhurst, he became (1894) an officer in the 4th hussars. On leave in 1895, he saw his first military action in Cuba as a reporter for London's Daily Graphic. He served in India and in 1898 fought at Omdurman in Sudan under Kitchener. Having resigned his commission, he was sent (1899) to cover the South African War by the Morning Post, and his accounts of his capture and imprisonment by the Boers and his escape raised him to the forefront of English journalists.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nEarly Government Posts\n\nChurchill was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1900, but he subsequently switched to the Liberal party and was appointed undersecretary for the colonies in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Under Asquith, he was initially (1908–10) president of the Board of Trade, then home secretary (1910–11), and championed innovative labor exchange and old-age pension acts. As first lord of the admiralty (1911), he presided over the naval expansion that preceded World War I.\n\nDiscredited by the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, which he had championed, Churchill lost (1915) his admiralty post and served on the front lines in France. Returning to office under Lloyd George, he served as minister of munitions (1917) and secretary of state for war and for air (1918–21). As colonial secretary (1921–22), he helped negotiate the treaty that set up the Irish Free State.\n\nAfter two defeats at the polls he returned to the House of Commons, as a Constitutionalist, and became (1924–29) chancellor of the exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government. As an advocate of laissez-faire economics, he was strongly criticized by John Maynard Keynes. Churchill was not a financial innovator; he basically followed conventional advice from his colleagues. Nevertheless, Churchill's decision to return the country to the prewar gold standard in

Early Christians. The roots of Mardi Gras, Easter, and Christmas celebrations can be traced back to ancient Roman celebrations. As the Christian religion was forming, it was easier to bring converts from other religions if the major celebrations were kept intact, but given new Christian meanings. It is clear from the Bible that the Nativity didn't happen in winter (lambs aren't born then nor do shepherds tend them in the fields). The Roman feast of Saturnalia which included decorating with evergreen boughs and giving presents in an effort to entice the sun to return for another year was transformed into a celebration of the birth of Christ. The Roman feast of Oestre in the springtime, a celebration of fertility that included rabbits and eggs, was transformed by the Christians into Easter. \n\nLent is a 40 day period of abstinence prior to Easter. As one last blow-out, a celebration was held prior to the beginning of Lent. As the Lenten festival devloped over the centuries, it spread from 12th Night (supposedly the night the Wise Men arrived at Nazareth, actually the 12th night after Christmas) and lasted until Fat Tuesday, the day before the 40 days of Lent began.\n\n"Mardi Gras" is French for Fat Tuesday. The festival has had other names in other languages. It cemented in our culture due to a 1699 French explorer who landed at a point in Louisiana on Fat Tuesday and named the place Point du Mardi Gras in honor of the celebration taking place in his native country.

Having a large gun (automatic pistol, probably a 45 or a 9mm) shoved in my chest by a guy wanting money, of which I only had $3.23 on me and/or my leather jacket, then a guy at the end of the car started talking crazy, distracted the guy with the gun long enough for a REALLY big dude to grab my coller, pull me out of my shock and my seat and yank me to the next car, then at the next stop he shoved me out of the car and told me to run. I wanted out of there so bad, I never turned to thank him for saving my life.

My daughter is also in 8th grade and you can appreciate the number of hours we dads struggle with these projects.....I am currently building (helping to build) a miniature, erupting volcano.....You know kids like flash....they love the show. I sat here for a while and thought how about a real timer, like an old style egg timer. you know, the ones with the big knob that you wind up? A 6 volt battery and a filament or model rocket igniter.(you can get these at the hobby store or make your own out of wire.....My daughter and I built a series of light bulbs for a 7th grade science project ) If you run a wire from the battery and glue it on the timer at an appropriate location...then glue(attach) the other wire to the knowb so that when the timer is wound up the wire moves toward the other and completes the circuit in the appropriate amount of time. Connect a piece if thin wire as a "gate" to hold the ball and when the timer runs out the battery energizes the wire causing it to melt...the ball rolls down the ramp. Have fun.....

First, the Speedometer predates the Speed Limit.\n\nSecond, they tried reducing the numbers on the Speedometer and drivers didn't like it. In fact, they paid extra to buy racing gauges.\n\nAnd Third, speedometers are usually spring activated. The more the go to the right the more the spring is strained. Over time the sping gets spung and the needle begins to float and stick and give you inacurate readouts. So. if you keep the needle on the left hand side of the dial it should keep functioning longer and designing the dial to do so makes perfect sense.
Well, hold on a sec.\n\nThe "perfect" stick isn't necessarily a $200+ composite.\n\nLots of guys in the NHL and elsewhere still use wood. I use wood. The perfect stick is a combination of a lot of factors. Flex, weight, length, what kind of blade you have and how the curve works for you.\n\nFlex has to do with how much weight (pressure) it takes to bend your stick. That translates directly back to how much force it snaps back with when it unbends, which affects your shots in terms of how fast the puck goes when it comes off your stick.\n\nIn both a slap shot and a wrister, your stick is bending right as you collect the puck, and unbendending as it leaves your blade. That rubberband effect gives the puck that much more velocity, which is why in theory a flexible stick gives a more rocketing shot.\n\nThe thing is, that's not always what you want. Defensemen tend to like a stiffer stick \n\n(pause to giggle)\n\nand smaller forwards like a more flexible stick, but that's a huge generalization and in the end it comes down to personal preference. I'm small and comparatively light, so I use an 85# stick. For a big guy that would be ridiculous whippy, but it works just great for me.\n\nThe other thing to remember is... there's being cheap and then there's being reasonable.\n\nPatrick Marleau can break three sticks a game because the club picks up his equipment tab.\n\nYou buy that $200+ Synergy or whatever and in two months when you break it in a game you're going to be really unhappy. And honestly, do you play well enough yet to really use a $200 stick to its best advantage?\n\nI use a $30 wood stick. Bouchard curve, 85#, with a lie that's good for my height (or lack thereof). I have two. I know where to get more when they break.\n\nMost of the guys I play with out here on the east coast play with wood sticks, and have all their lives. \n\nSo, you know. More in this case isn't necessarily better.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you're good enough that a $200 composite stick will really do something for you, who knows.\n\n** \n\nTo clarify, although I did say -- the numbers have to do with how much force it takes to bend your stick. 100 flex means it takes 100 pounds of pressure to bend your stick 1 inch. 85 flex means it takes 85 pounds. The higher the number, the stiffer the stick. The lower, the bendier. \n\nAnd... FYI when you cut length off your stick you change the flex. The more you cut, the stiffer you make it.

I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but if you are looking to flirt like a pro my number one tip is always leave when the conversation is at its climax. Never wait until the conversation dulls down, e.g. awkward silence, to say something like, "I should get going." If you leave when the conversation has peaked, it makes her think you're interesting and leaves her to look forward to your next encounter. Thus, by the time you meet again hopefully you will have a great, entertaining story to tell her.
If they are anti-retroviral, they target reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme which converts ssRNA to dsDNA. \n\nI recall being taught that human cells do not have any reverse transcriptase, and that's why these drugs should work.\n\nHowever, I also recall picking up later the fact that there is some reverse transcriptase activity in humans (one paper is referenced below).\n\nThat being said, viral RTase activity will be way higher than human telomerase (the subject of the paper referenced below), since most of our cells are typically non-dividing. So targetting RTase activity still works because the viral enzyme is extremely active, and the virus will be greatly disrupted by blocking its activity. Wheras the human RTase is normally inactive, and non-replicating cells don't need it.

It's from the film "Down Periscope". Right after they all get into the submarine and people are starting to get to know one another.
Softball like baseball is played by men and women. There are two types of softball, fast pitch and slow pitch. Four main differences between soft ball and baseball are that the ball is larger in the game of softball,the ball is pitched underhand, the bases are situated closer together and the pitching mound is considerably closer to the batter.\n\nWhile slow pitch softball is more a leisurely recreational game with much activity because the ball is pitched slow with a required arc and scoring is usually frequent, fast pitch softball is more a pitcher oriented low scoring game. Even the best of batters in fastball have difficulty hitting. Batting against top notch pitchers in fast pitch soft ball is not for the faint of heart. The ball comes from the mound which is only 40-46 feet away, and at speeds upwards of 80 mph. Soft ball games are usually only 7 innings long and in top competitive games it is not unusual for pitchers to attain 12 -15 strikeouts. \nBelieve me, some of the best MLB players would have difficulty looking good at the plate in elite player fastball (softball) games, whether it is a man or a woman pitching.
It is advertising on a world wide scale.
We live life in order to make the decision to follow God, through Jesus Christ. That is my opinion as a Christian. I feel that we are supposed to bring as many people as possible with us to Heaven and to live as good a life as possible. We are called to strive for perfection, even though we can never attain it in this world. We have no idea what we will know or remember when we die. We will know our loved ones, but we will not cry. It may be that just the bad memories are taken away. I can't presume what Heaven will be like, but it is supposed to be better than this world can ever be. It is perfect. Blessings to you and good luck in your search.
No, it is not, but it helps :)
i'm willing to confess. why would i want to hide it? everyone is responsible for their acts. i expect truthfulness from anyone else so why would i chickened out?\nand yeah i think sharing past mistakes is good so you can help others from making the same mistake you did. though this is a bit inconvenient if you made mistake of more embarrassing nature...
I don't feel advertising is totally at fault. We as individuals have free will and fine minds to choose what we purchase. Sometimes people have Image and Reality issues. Many attractive people look in the mirror and actually don't see themselves in a positive light. Boils down to what influenced your own self efficacy, and even how a person was raised to make decisions.Old proverb> A fool and his Money are soon Parted.

Everyone likes Brasil because they don't know any other team or players and say to themselves, "hey other idiots like Brasil, so they must be good." People who actually know about football have their own pick to win it, not some band wagon pick that most of the population in the Americas have picked. And anyone who has half a brain knows that there is a big chance that Brasil won't win it all.

I suppose it comes from our "Puritan" roots. The first pilgrims to come here (European, mainly English anyway) came with the intent of setting up religious communities. That is where we get the idea of freedom of religion- because they were escaping persecution in Europe- but in reality their rules were every bit as (if not more so) religiously tyrannical than where they came from. I guess that rather than dying out through the years, the idea that "our way is the only way and you can go to hell if you don't follow us" has continued and in some ways grown.

Well, most likely the mothers were not around. Hammers are a strange breed. They school a lot during the day, mostly small to medium.(credit of the lines below go to: .geocities.com/RainForest/Andes/1151/)\n\nAnother unusual thing hammerheads do is form schools. These schools can contain hundreds of individuals, with the largest known schools containing as many as 500. The reason why hammerheads school and other sharks do not is unknown. Hammerheads only school during the day. They break up at night to do their feeding. Because the schools contain mainly small to medium sized hammerheads, it is believed that they school to reduce the risk of predation from larger sharks. It is also believed that an order of dominance exists in the schools based on age, size and sex. \n\nI have attached a few links of my favorite hammer sites\n\nEnjoy and good to hear you took your family out fishing

I'm not a smoker, but it's amazing how few rights smokers have these days. The one that gets me is that it's illegal to smoke in a bar. Everyone's drinking poison and attempting to have sex with someone they've never met, but heaven forbid someone smoke a cigarette.
You have a build-up of lactic acid in your legs. You need to flush it out to ease your discomfort. A massage may help, so will lots of water and moderate exercise like walking. If nothing else, your discomfort will ease in a few days.

Any language that is spoken in different places and among different social classes will have varieties. The larger the number of speakers using that language, the greater the variety. Regional varieties are called dialects. Social varieties are called sociolects. Subvarieties are occasionally called communolects and individual varieties are called idiolects.

Albert Speer, the son of an architect, was born in Mannheim on 19th March, 1905. After studying architecture at the Munich Institute of Technology and at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Institute, he became an architect in 1927.\n\n\nAlbert Speer is said to have prolonged the war for at least a year, with the consequent death of hundreds of thousands and widespread ruin. It also gave the Nazis more time to pursue their mass murder of Jews, Russians, Gypsies and others deemed not fit to live.\nHere are some wonderful sites from where you can get all the information you want about Speer.\nhttp://www.dataphone.se/~ms/speer/welcom.htm\nhttp://www.auschwitz.dk/Speer.htm\nhttp://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERspeer.htm\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/features/hitlers-helpers.shtml

Both are racists, spouting extreme views and both should have been convicted.\n\nThe difference? Rahman is an extremist nutter, who talks shite and nobody actually listens to. He is wrong to say what he said and deserved jail, but since no-one took him seriously, he posed no threat and did not incite violence. However, the law deals with his intention, and that was certainly to incite violence. The fact that he didn't succeed is neither here nor there.\n\nGriffin is an intelligent manipulator of his group of thugs who hang on his racist words like mad dogs.\n\nThe fact that Griffin spoke at a closed meeting is irrelevant. His words were intended to incite crimes of violence and arson against non-whites by his half-witted foot soldiers. He should have been convicted.

Yeah, probably early 30s. I wouldn't leave it much longer than that, because there are risks associated with being pregnant when you are older.\n\nTrouble is, I think men can often sense the biological clock ticking, and feel the desperation coming from a woman in that situation, and they get frightened off. I wouldn't like to be in that position at all. I would say if having children with someone is high on the list of priorities, do it sooner rather than later.
The actions and ablutions that accompany the obligatory prayers changes based on the prayer (there are three obligatory prayers - one of which needs to be said every day). What is consistent across the board is that there is a need to do ablutions - washing one's hands and face - before saying the prayer. Almost everything else is different. Finally, we are told there is a wisdom to these actions that is not obvious.\n\nShort obligatory prayer:\n1. Perform ablutions\n2. Face toward Baha'u'llah's burial site in Akka Israel.\n\nMedium obligatory prayer:\n1. "Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and while he washeth, let him say"\n2. "And while washing his face, let him say"\n3. "Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e., Bahji, 'Akká), let him say"\n4. "Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say"\n5. "Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward the face, let him say"\n6. "Let him, then, be seated and say"\n\nLong Obligatory Prayer\nThe number of things to list for the long obligatory prayer is quite long. This list of the action required in order is below:\n\nLet him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:\n\nLet him then stand and say:\n\nLet him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name. Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God -- blessed and exalted be He -- and say:\n\nLet him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his hands thrice, and say:\n\nLet him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground, say:\n\nLet him then seat himself and say:\n\nLet him then stand erect and say:\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands resting on the knees, and say:\n\nLet him then rise and say:\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead to the ground, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:\n\n- Baha'u'llah, Prayers and Meditations by Baha'u'llah, p. 322

Here are excerpts from the California Vehicle Code (VC) relating to your question: \n\nd) Every bicycle operated upon any highway during darkness shall be equipped with the following:\n\n 1. A lamp emitting a white light which illuminates the highway and is visible from a distance of 300 feet to the front and the sides of the bicycle. \n\n 2. A red reflector mounted on the rear of the bicycle and visible from 500 feet to the rear of the bicycle. \n \n 3. A white or yellow reflector mounted on each pedal visible 200 feet to the front and rear of the bicycle and a white or red reflector on each side to the rear of the center of the bicycle, except bicycles which are equipped with reflectorized tires on the front and the rear need not be equipped with side reflectors. All reflectorized tires must meet DMV requirements. \n\ne) A lamp or lamp combination, emitting a white light, attached to the operator and visible from a distance of 300 feet in front and from the sides of the bicycle, may be used in place of a lamp attached to the bike.\n\nI've seen some cyclists with lights attached to their helmets. I think that would be better than one attached to the handlebars. You can also get the red lights for the back. Mine has different blinking settings. I didn't attach mine to the bike but clip it on my jersey or belt bag when it gets dark.\n\nGood luck and ride safe with a helmet!

Peace and Submission that's islam. But God has never forbidden muslim to defend themselves when they are being attack, and those who defends themselves are being called terrorist by the west>

*Shaking my furry skull* Noperz, the only guaranteed way to get a negative test is to not do the drugs. Especially pot as it will stay in your system for up to 30 days.\n\nNow mind you, there are things one can do to get false negatives, drinking lots of liquids, certain compounds sold on the market ect.\n\nProblem is, if the urine is too clear like drinking liquids will do, that is grounds for rejection and they will want another sample. With additives they test for that as soon as they become aware of the additive and then you fail for that.\nOften you are not left alone when the sample is given so cannot substitute for clean urine, dilute, or put in a negative creating chemical.\n\nWhich leaves one with the choice of before even giving the sample taking and informing the lab at collection time things like advil (for thc) which will result in a false positive even if you are clean. But at best you only delay your test.\n\nWhich gets us right back to must stay clean for the period of time it takes for the drugs to leave your system.\n\nMind you, you can do a search online for more info, but no one is gonna say "Oh gee they now test for our product." So buyer beware.

Generally no. You cannot buy life insurance for anyone. You must have a relationship with such person. There must be insurable interest.\n\nSomeone who lives a dangerous life like a active duty military personnel, a pilot, someone who does extreme sports, etc, are usually not insurable by any insurance company. Though some will do it, but you will have to pay a very high premium.\n\nThere are questions on the life application that the agent must read. If the person you are trying to insure matches any of the dangerous occupations, then the agent must not go further in the application.

There is nothing worse than seeing an older guy dress like he is younger than he really is and drives sports cars. Personally, that is a turn off.
I couldnt agree with you any more. Brazil is a team of has beens and show offs. I doubt they could even beat france (hoping they can't). Their game against Australia was so bad. Ronaldo was offside on his firrst goal and Australia wasn't awarded a clear penalty. AThe Brazilians are relying on counterattacks only. Their defence is clearly prone to germany's attacks and Italy's attacks and the french style and Rooney. Italy is the most rounded team this tournament although they arent playing with their heart. Im hoping that they can beat the Germans without tiring themselves a lot.
no.....its easy to get attached to a person and develope feelings for them too. It shouldn't matter anymore if it's a girl or a guy. you have to look inside your self and ask if your the one with a problem with it or not. plus girls wind up having a closer connection with ech other anyway. We know what we like and also how to deal with each other. That and we are really good listeners and we are more in touch with our feelings and how to express them. Goodluck i hope you get the answers your looking for and the chance to be happy!

Originally, there was enough to feed 135 people for 28 days, so 135 * 28 = 3,780 daily rations.\n\nAfter 9 days, there were 135 * 19 = 2,565 daily rations. Now there are 36 additional people, making 135 + 36 = 171 people. New rations are 3/4 the original size, so there are 4/3 * 2,565 = 3,420 "new rations".\n\n3,420 "new rations" / 171 people = 20 days. Add back the original 9, and the food lasts 29 days.

according to the 2000 U S census 2.4 % of households had income of greater than $200,000. 2.2% had incomes from $150,000 to $200,000. That data is 7 years old and with inflation and the fact that the rich are always getting richer, we can probably extrapolate that it is 3.5% to 4.0%

This may produce more questions than answers for you :)\n\nIt depends on what kind of chemistry you want to study... bio-chemistry; pharmaceuticals; textiles-chemistry; packaging sciences; etc. etc.\n\nIn New York State there are many Chemistry programs: St. John's University has a pharmaceutical program... Queens College of the City University of New York has a BioChemistry program (also with a connection to Psychology); Rochester Institute has a packaging sciences program; State Univeristy of New York at Stonybrook has a medical program with connected hospital.\n\nIf you're not sure which branch(es) of Chemistry you want to study, do some research on University Laboratories and Research Facilities. I'm sure they are all "State-of-the-art" and "award-winning", but just reading about the various ones should help narrow down your decisions. :)
First of all "projectisation" is not really a word (at least not officially, since it does not appear in reference dictionaries), but it if it did, it would probably mean the act of turning something into a project, or structuring something like a project.\n\nIt is always hard to guess the true meaning of a word outside of context, but my best guess is this word was made up by someone to talk about the introduction of formal procedures (such as scheduling, planning, resource management, etc.) into an activity which was very informal before, or making it more business-like in general.

ARM = Adjustable Rate Mortgage, this should be avoided when you know that you are going to live in the same house for more than 5 years. ARM mortgage can be 3,5 or 7 yr ARM. In these first 3,5 or 7 yrs are generally fixed and then for rest of the term it is Adjustable.\nFixed rates are best these days if you can get a rate less than 6.75%. If you want to go for adjustable rate make sure there is a cap and it should not go more than 7% otherwise some times the interest payment can go higher than the principle. I am sure you don't want that.\nGood Luck with your Mortgage
Technically, you've served in the military. So, your honestly answer should be "Yes".\n\nHowever, it may impede your chances of employment.\n\nIf you apply of government jobs and you answer "no" and they find out otherwise, you can not only face losing your job, but also face criminal fines and/or jail time. This goes the same if you apply for some government contractor's job.\n\nSome states and with some bigger companies (like Best Buy) can seek charges if you falsified any information on your official application.\n\nServing in the military and receiving an OTH discharge because of being AWOL is just as bad as going to jail or had charges with a crime.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you finished training or not. You signed on the dotted line and said I swear/affirm. The fact that your DD Form 214 or other documents state that you were discharged from military service, shows you had served. Good thing for you, you didn't received a Dishonorable Discharge (this is worse), instead you got an Other Than Honorable.\n\nIt sucks but it would behoove you to be honest, because at least it will show them you have integrity. Just be honest and upfront why you went AWOL and why the military was a mistake for you.
I would try to pull out the inherent properties in the problem as they relate to the possible choices. For example, in this one, we have:\n\nx < 0\n0 < y < 1\nz > 1\n\nFor (a), we are told that x^2 - z^2 is always negative. In this case, we want to either note that x^2 - z^2 factors into (x+z)(x-z) or that x^2 = (-x)^2. Both would suggest that we can make x^2 - z^2 ZERO by choosing any x = -z (e.g. z = 2, x = -2) so (a) is immediately shown FALSE.\n\nFor (b), we note that if z > 1, 0 < 1/z < 1 so that we can let y = 1/z.\n\nFor (c), we simply note that the product of 2 nonzero Real numbers can never be zero.\n\nFor (d), we either note that y^2 - z^2 = (y+z)(y-z) so that we have the product (positive + positive)(smaller # - bigger #) = (positive)(negative) = negative or that squaring a positive number less than 1 will only make the number smaller while squaring a positive number greater than 1 will only make the number bigger so that we get smaller # - bigger # = -#.\n\nTherefore some sort of algebraic analysis is usually the fastest way to attack these problems. Obviously though, seeing all these tricks takes an understanding and familiarity with algebra. However, many of the algebraic techniques you need for standardized tests is actually captured in this one problem.\n\nIt'll also help to know when to reverse inequality signs. For this, understanding increasing/decreasing functions is critical. For example, if you're subtracting 10 from both sides of an inequality, you look at the graph of y = x - 10 and see that it is strictly increasing (i.e. the larger the values you plug in, the larger the ones you get). Therefore, in this case, you would not reverse the inequality sign. If you were multiplying by -2 you would see a strictly decreasing graph and would therefore reverse the inequality sign.\n\nIf you need to guess, plugging in values such as -1, 0, and 1 where appropriate are best for counterexamples. Also in cases with questions such as above as "which one is false", look for answers that appear to be broader in scope. For example, (c) is pretty narrow. All it says is that xy cannot obtain one specific value so it is likely to be true. We can also look at the wording for clues. (b) uses weak wording: CAN (without the never) is not very restrictive, and in fact, it can be argued on a technicality that (b) is never false. For example, "pigs can fly" is true in an imaginative person's dreams. (a) and (d) both use strong working, but (a) is broader. x can assume ANY value less than 0 whereas y must be between 0 and 1, exclusively. Lastly, look for choices that are equivalent. If x > 0 and x^2 > 0 are both possibilities, we can eliminate both since they are equivalent conditions. and they can't both be TRUE/FALSE when we are only allowed to pick one or the other.
First of all, Kansas City is in Missouri a misnomer in its self. The Pirates would be in with White sox Indians, Tigers and Twins.KC would be in with Cubs, Brewers,Cardnials,STros,and Reds.KC would be switching to a six team division.Natural rivalry all the way around.So, KC would be way worse off. But, it doesnt really matter since both teams are mathimatcally eliminated by the end of April.

I've heard this before - actually when I was teaching English in France!\nIts not meant to be taken literally, its more of a satirical look at the way other countries see the States. For example, have you also got one which says "In England, you must always start a converstion with a comment about the weather" ? That's because we do like to talk about the weather here. Its a kind of stereotype, for our modern times.\n\nIt is also not meant to offend anyone!

I went and had time to reflect on my life.After surgery i came home to Akron Ohio and was homeless,I just said God help me I've hit bottom. He answered my prayers I went to a homeless shelter,they had a residential program for christian living well I asked to go into the program.they helped me to understand life and find a way to live a better life. Part of the program was to help feed and make beds of the homeless.I stayed there for over five months and it was GREAT.I now try try to do something good for someone each day.I have been off drugs and booze since Sept 13,2003 and God willing it will be for the rest of my life.

Rather than taking out a $25,000 loan, try setting up a repayment plan. By incurring further debt, you are laying the foundation for another bankruptcy. Contact each of your debtors, tell them your situation and then tell them how much you can pay them each month. Most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to repayment. If there are interest rates involved, ask that the interest rates be reduced while you try to pay the money back. In the long run, this is a far better solution than incurring more debt.

I'm not exactly a scholar of Arkansas state law, put a prenup is, first, a contract. So it has to have all the same things a contract does. The parties have to understand it, agree to it, and each give up something of value. All of its terms have to be written down and it has to be sufficiently detailed so that it's not an "agreement to agree."\n\nPrenups are frequently signed between people of unequal power - one wealthy, one less so. For that reason, most states will insist that the parties be given some extra rights. Each must have access to an attorney, ample time to consider the prenup, and must have received fairly complete disclosure about the finances of the other. One or more of these may be waived but the more unequal the position of the parties, the less likely courts will be to allow such waivers. \n\nSome states also require prenups to be sworn and notarized, a requirement not necessary for your average contract.\n\nAnd couples will have a hard time making an agreement about child support and visitation. These issues are almost always open for the courts to re-decide them.

Actually, it sounds like sexual harrassment. I teach this stuff in middle school. It is called quid pro quo and he could ask you to do him a "favor" because he knows you like him and will do things to keep him interested. Stay with friends. Please don't be alone with him and if it gets weird (which it will) tell him to stop or tell a friend to help you talk to Josh. Sounds just like a situation at my school with a boy named Josh who is older because he was ledt back and I know, he'd use the power of "the crush" to get sexual favors from a girl and not feel bad about it at all. If you are my student at VSM, figure out who I am and we'll talk privately. I promise. If not, be careful and go with your gut instinct. he does NOT have a crush on you.

Selon Frank Herbert (ou plus précisément un des personnages de la série Dune) la Religion s'oppose à la Sexualité car il ne peut y avoir de plaisir réel que dans l'Amour de Dieu.\nL'Amour charnel n'est donc qu'hérésie.\n\nSi cette théorie est un peu extrême, il me semble qu'effectivement l'amour de dieu demandé par la Religion est si total, et le plaisir rendu par cette foi si complet, que l'Homme ne devrait pas avoir besoin de l'amour, charnel mais aussi platonique.
My Savior was beaten and tortured beyond recognition. He was crucified which was the most humiliating method of death at the time. He was cursed, spat upon and denied. Although it is in my heart to share the changes in my life that came from the simple faith in that, what makes you think words of mere people can shake that? It's frustrating that something so simple is beyond the grasp of so many. Like the jokes about "college-educated people" having no common sense, non-believers are so insistent on needing science to prove this and that. I read all those books, saw artifacts and evidence of biblical truths before I was saved and they didn't mean anything to me then either. Trying to talk to non-believers about Christ is like talking to many teens about moral issues. They don't understand that we were teens listening to "all that" at one time, too. Then came some point, some event in our life where we grew up. I am a Christian. I have given up nothing of value to accept Christ. Nor can I describe to someone who's never experienced it, the joy or peace I feel inside now. I don't understand why they're so concerned that I "waste my time" believing in something they don't. I know what happens after my time here, but even if they had been right, what would it matter? They all believed we'd die and that's it. Bless you for asking, but my faith is in great shape, thanks.

Sorry to hear of your problems with Insurance.\n\nMost UK policies will provide cover for damage caused by escape of water (eg a leak).\n\nThe Insurance will pay for the cost to repair the damaged caused by the leak (eg water damage to carpet etc) - It will not repair the leak itself.\n\nThis would be the same situation with Liverpool Victoria.\n\nThe same applies to your fridge breakdown - Your home Insurance policy will pay to replace the damaged food caused by the breakdowm, but it will not replace or repair the fridge.\n\nThere are seperate Insurance policies available to cover the breakdown of white goods in your home (eg, fridge, freezer, washing machine etc), but these are expensive and will only provide cover if the items are less that 2 or 3 years old - This means the more your need it (because your white goods are getting older and more likely to brekadown), the less likely they will insure you.\n\nI'm not sure you will get any insurance to cover you for the cost of repairing a leak - try you Water Company, as sometimes they have a policy which will pay for one of their engineers to come out and fix the problem - but I think it is expensive for what you get.\n\nWith regards to the best Home Insurance company in the UK, I suggest you speak to a local Insurance Broker - Cheap isn't always the best. I would recommend you make sure any quotation includes Accidental Damage as a minimum. You may also want to opt for cover outside your home (eg jewellery, bikes, camera equipment etc) - but this will cost extra.\n\nGood luck with your search.....
The answers about 1kg being 1kg no matter what the metal are correct.\n\nThe heaviest metal is Osmium which has a specifc gravity of approx 22 and a half - meaning that it weights 22 and a half times as much as water, to put it into context a bucket of water weighs about 10kg but a bucket of osmium would weigh nearly quarter of a ton. It's about twice as heavy as lead.\n\nJust out of interest, if you had a lump of anti-matter about the size of a marble it would weight the same as the whole earth.

I thought you were going to perform surgery on me."\n\nThe reply you'll get is, "Sweetheart we already did it.\nYour brain enterprates that only a split second has passed.\n\nThey are going to put you to sleep with an anesthesia, we call "twilight sleep." It's mild but keeps you asleep so you don't feel any pain. You wake up quickly from it and will be able to go home as soon as you can walk without falling down.\n\nIt has a tendancy to make you a little wobbly for about a half hour after you wake up.\n\nTrust me, you will probably get a kick out of this. It's over before you know it and you won't have any scarey feelings.\n\nYou will however probably feel just a tiny bit of nausea(sick to your stomach) for about half an hour after waking up as well.\nThis is normal and it goes away quickly.\n\nAny jittery or nervousness you will feel, is just the anesthesia wearing off and that too passes quickly.\n\nOnce you go through this experience, you will never be frighted again.\n\nI promise. If ANYTHING, you'll probably get a kick out of it, like I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe only thing you'll remember is feeling REALLY GREAT before it's nighty night time, which takes only seconds.

I will treat this as the question you asked. There are several ways that children can be introduced to witchcraft. When I encounter interested young people, I tend to direct them to the Tarot unless I think they are capable of learning more rapidly. \n\nI know what you are thinking: "What does a byzantine card game played between devout christians and muslims in the time of the crusades have to do with witchcraft?" well it was turned into a simple and easy to use divinatory system by A E Waite. \n\nPoetry is another good way to introduce young people into the occult. The poet William Butler Yeats was a member of the hermetic order of the golden dawn and has written extensively on the occult. \n\nAnother good way for children to get into witchcraft is for them to study the bible. Infact, more pagans come from homes that hold to a strict and rigid interpretation of the bible than come from any other source. Even for non christian households, playing with the bible can be a fun diversion. \n\nIf they aren't interested in studying scripture, perhaps they should learn by example. (I don't advise this, the early christian demon summonings could be a little much for some children.) The early christians practiced several forms of magic including the following: \n\nhttp://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/magic/agg.display.html \n\nIncluded in there are love spells that torture the subject until they give in to the intent of the spell. Many of the details are missing, but a careful study of history can fill in those details. \n\nAlchemy was a more accepted form of witchcraft that holds true to more traditional christian values. Famous Alchemists such as Sir Newton, and N Flamel helped us to bring alchemy into a form of science, but it has still shaped modern western magic more than any other single magical endeavor. \n\nFinally, in the 1950s wicca came about. It has been popular with young and old people alike who are interested in learning about the supernatural. It has some of the same values that christians do, but it tends to be more free about them. \n\nWicca developed out of cerimonial witchcrft such as that practiced by the Golden dawn. It did not come before Christianity as was once claimed, but it does draw from spiritual paths arround the world that are far older than Christianity.

She should go to her gynecologist right away. Some yeast infections need extra strength medication only a doctor can prescribe and she should have tests done because it may not be just a yeast infection. Is she taking antibiotics? This can bring on a yeast infection. Also, a home remedy that my friend swears by is a plain yogurt douche. My friend says that rubbing it on the irritated skin, soothes it too. She should wear loose clothing and cotton panties. Yeast infections can occur due to stress. Make sure she is not too stressed.

Some companies choose to reinvest their profits to make their company grow. Companies that do not give out dividend can and do start giving them out, either as special dividends or regular dividends. Just a little while ago, Microsoft gave out a huge dividend as a one-time deal. If a company does not give out dividends, you make your money when you sell the stock. Any retained earnings should increase the value of the stock.
I have heard that there are other means for obtaining stem cells without taking them from fetus's. They need to concentrate their research on doing that instead of killing something. In other words the ends do not justify the means. Think about it this way, if they abort a child how do we know if that kid isn't going to grow up someday to develop a cure for cancer or HIV. Another thing that I don't understand is the same people who agree with abortions and fetal stem cell research are the same ones who cry everytime they use a monkey for medical research. So I guess they thinks its ok to kill a human being, but not an animal. That is very twisted.\nMy advice to you is get informed on the whole thing including the technical aspects and where they are with their research and then form your own opinion.

There are many reasons why this could be happening. To give you a more appropriate answer, you would have to be much more specific. For instance, do you have a Widows based computer or a Mac? (If it's crashing I'm assuming Windows). :P What operating system is installed (ex. Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc.) Next, we need to know what kind of hardware you have. Is this a Dell, Gateway, IBM? What kind of software is installed on the machine?\n\nFor now, I'll give you some ideas. Perhaps your computer is freezing due to some software you added that is causing problems. When did the crashes start? If you did not have crashes until after you installed or downloaded a program, that may be the problem. Try to remember, and uninstall any programs that you don't use or need. \n\nSpyware/Adware/Malware can cause problems for your computer as well.

Four Score and Seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth on this continent- a new nation - concieved in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war. Testing whether that Nation- or any Nation so concieved can long endure.\n\nWe are met on a great battlefield of that war- we have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place of those who gave their lives- that this Nation might live. It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.\n\nbut in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will not remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to dedicate ourselves to finishing the work that they so nobly started here. \n\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\n\nThat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that the government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from this earth.
Missions don't last forever. Young men typically serve a 2-year mission between the ages of 19-21.\n Ask him where he's from and how mush time he has left on his mission. Above all: respect his current objective: Serving a mission in the name of Jesus Christ. Respect that and he'll very much appreciate it and respect you all the more. After his mission is complete he can date and/or marry whom ever he chooses.
Polymeric materials like plastic are made up of big molecules, and these very long molecules are disposed in a chaotic way, and there are links between molecules, It's something similar to a spaghetti dish and this structure is defined amorphous because there is no order. When plastic is put under stress these molecules are stretched and in that places the structure become more tidy , so it became crystalline, and crystalline structures are opaque, while amorphous structures are transparent.\nPigments are not important in this phenomenon.

I went through that a couple years ago, and I feel your pain! No one understands how much that really does hurt!! Mine was like I had sat on a sword, sharp side up!!\n\nI had ovarian cysts, and other cysts on misc. female organs, and I also had endo (endometriosis--which in basic terms is scar tissue on your femaile organ/s) caused by it growing in the wrong place. First the docs put me through a year of different birth control pills and the patch, then I had a laperoscomy done (which proved their was the endo), and a few months after that I ended up having a partial hysterectomy. The doc took my cervix and uterus, leaving my tubes and ovaries, because they didn't have much endo on them at the time). I still get cysts on my ovaries though, and it's definately painful--just not as bad as before my surgery. Below are two links, the first is about ovarian cysts, and the second is about endo. Both of good links that can get you more information (instead of putting it all down here and you have to skim through to find what you want, I thought the websites can lead you in the direction you want to go, not where I think you want to go...lol\nGood luck! Hope you feel better soon! \n\n(hot water bottles on my abdomen or a fresh towel out of the dryer always helped my pain)

Illegal immigration describes migration across national borders without complying with the legal requirements. Some people call those they suspect of illegally immigrating, "illegal immigrants" or "undocumented immigrants". \n\nPeople who arrive in a legal manner but then outstay their visas (that is the authorized time in the host country), may also have illegal status. The term illegal immigrant is highly contested because some consider it unnecessarily pejorative

I'm sorry to hear you weren't happy with our course. My suggestion to you is to envoke the Higher Score Guarantee and get a free repeat. For most effect, enroll in a once-a-week course with a different teacher. There are so many resources available for practice, and taking the time to apply what you've learned at each lesson to practice material is what will get you more points. I'm sure your score will go up given a bit of patience and a lot of practice. Feel free to contact me at the San Jose Kaplan center.\nLighty

a sneeze is simply an involuntary nervous response to nasal irritation. According to this nifty science blog entry, the sneeze impulse affects a variety of body parts, including the abdomen, chest, neck, and face. During a sneeze, the impulses that travel through your face cause your eyelids to blink. This response is entirely automatic. There's nothing you can do about it. Sneezing puts a lot of pressure on your head and respiratory system, so blinking is probably a protective mechanism.\n The point is that all of these responses (the abdominal contraction, the sharp burst of air out of your lungs, the general lunging movement) are intertwined. When you sneeze, you can't do one without the other.
I am an atheist. \n\nFirst, fear of punishment keeps people from breaking the law, whether secular or temporal. I don't rob a bank because I don't want to go to jail. I have actually heard that religion came about because of evolution as a way to keep people from killing each other. Laws can have their source from religion, but they should be secular in nature(like letting gays marry). I personally have found that atheist are more likely to be christian in their actions with others and christians. I think it is because atheist have taken more possession of their lives, and therefore the responsibility.
butch?
you are right... 5 is better than 30. 30 is better than 40. None is the best. I smoked and then only had 1 cigarette in July each year. The mistake about it all is that unlike eating which you can't stop, smoking can be. \n\nMy doctor explained the problem as the effects of one cigarette might be to elevate your blood pressure by constricting your blood vessels. Not good if you have high blood pressure since the problems compound. \n\nIf 5 did no harm, how could 5 cigarettes taken 6 times a day hurt you? Leave them if you are strong enough and they don't control your life.... QUIT

There is a layer, called the heterosphere, in which the earth's atmosphere has varying composition. As the altitude increases, the atmosphere is dominated successively by helium, molecular hydrogen, and atomic hydrogen. The precise altitude of the heterosphere and the layers it contains varies significantly with temperature. The heterosphere generally extends from about 55 miles altitude right up to the edge of outer space. Surely you don't want somebody to figure out the changes in gravity over that entire range.

Go is probably the oldest board games in Japan. It originated in China, and people still play it today. In fact, I think Yahoo may have a version of it in its online games. Its a very strategic game, and there's also an anime about it called Hikaru no Go which is partly responsible for comeback in popularity. Shogi is another ancient board game that's much like chess. The link below has a lot of information on Go. I hope that's useful to you ^_^

To the person who said Derek Jeter sucks, in a post not even related to whether he was good or not.\n\nYou obviously know nothign about baseball. First off, the man was second in baseball in batting average. He is also a much better defensive SS than the writers make out to believe just because the writers hate the Yankees. He is also the captain on the most winningest team in sports history. Any team in baseball would take Derek Jeter if they had the chance, how many other players can you say that for? Not many, not even A-Rod gets that kind of recognition anymore because of his post-season performance as of late. Derek Jeter is damn good and is going to be in the Hall of Fame when he is done. \n\n'Nuff said\n\nand as for the post...I'm going to assume 11.5 or 12, thats what most middle-infielders use in HS, College, and the Pros.

It is amazing how many people answered this question without having a clue as to what they are talking about. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, republican or democrat. You need only express a believe in a higher power and be a man above the age of 21 to join. Just contact your local lodge and tell them you want to learn more about becoming a member. They will be happy to answer your questions. There should be a number in the phone book, but if you absolutely can not find the contact info, let me know and I will try to help.\n\nTo address some of the other answers on here, first of all, neither of the George Bushes are Masons. Also, many of the members of my lodge are democrats, although discussion of politics is forbidden in meetings, and most of us are nowhere near weathly. Most of us are just decent people who are trying to improve ourselves and our communities. We have black, white, Asian, and latino members. We have Christian, Jewish, and Muslim members. Race has nothing to do with it.\n\nBest of luck to you in your quest to join our institution.

Merton, Thomas \n \n \n1915—68, American religious writer and poet, b. France. He grew up in France, England, and the United States and studied at Cambridge Univ. and at Columbia (B.A., 1938; M.A., 1939). Converted to the Roman Catholic Church during his college career, he became in 1941 a Trappist monk. He was later ordained a priest and is known in religion as Father M. Louis. Merton died as a result of an accident in Thailand while attending an ecumenical council of Catholic and Buddhist monks. Among his volumes of poems are Figures for an Apocalypse (1947), The Tears of the Blind Lions (1949), and The Strange Islands (1957). Best known of his books are his autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain (1948, repr. 1970), two volumes on Trappist life, The Waters of Siloe (1949) and The Sign of Jonas (1953, repr. 1973), and Mystics and Zen Masters (1967). His Seeds of Contemplation (1949), The Silent Life (1957), and New Seeds of Contemplation (1962, rev. ed. 1972) are volumes of meditations. Also of interest are his Disputed Questions (1960), Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander (1966), Faith and Violence (1968), Contemplation in a World of Action (1971), The Journals of Thomas Merton (Vol. I, 1995), and his Asian journal, ed. by Naomi Burton et al. (1973).\n\nSee A Thomas Merton Reader, ed. by T. P. McDonnell (1962); study by J. T.

If the guy is decent, cares about you and wants a relationship with you and not just sex, then NO it will not put him off. \n\nI actually understand when you say you think it's degrading- I have also felt like that before, when i was with someone who used to get me to do it all the time. It felt very degrading, like he was just getting an ego trip off it. I really struggle with it now, I very rarely feel comfortable doing it although I hope this changes eventually...\n\nI do think though, that if you can build up a really great trusting and comfortable sexual relationship, you'll probably get over it and start feeling differently. As for technique, ask him to demonstrate how he likes it by sucking your fingers! That'll give you an idea of what to do. But even if you never come round to the idea, that's your deicision and don't let anyone tell you you're wrong.

You stand a greater chance of getting a government-guaranteed loan through the Small Business Administration http://www.sba.gov/financing than a government grant. Read the SBA Financing page to learn about criteria needed for borrowing \n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nI suggest you read the following books to get ideas of how to finance your business:\n\nFinancing Your Small Business http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1572484500/powerhomebizguid\nSmall Business Financing: How and Where To Get It http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0808007386/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing the Small Business: A Complete Guide to Obtaining Bank Loans and All Other Types of Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580626815/powerhomebizguid\nThe SBA Loan Book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158062202X/powerhomebizguid\nAngel Capital : How to Raise Early-Stage Private Equity Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471690635/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing Your Small Business (Barron's Business Library Series) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764124897/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online http://gtionline.fdncenter.org . It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.

Planets spin because the stuff that fell together gravitationally to make them up had angular momentum relative to the planet's axis. If a meteor comes in and hits the Earth, the chances are nearly zero that it will hit head on. A glancing blow will contribute to the Earth's angular momentum. If a planet or star falls together gravitationally from a cloud of matter, even if the cloud has very little rotational motion, the angular speed of spin is increased as the planet or star becomes more compact. This has to do with the conservation of angular momentum, and a typical example is that of a spinning ice skater pulling in his arms to rotate faster. Another example is the water draining in a sink. It almost always swirls around as it goes down the drain, even if there was very little apparent motion to begin with in the water in the sink.
Not in this household, and it would be better by far to purchase some commercial lube. Glycerin will produce a burning sensation, and honey, by providing glucose to feed the candida yeast organism that is naturally present on humans, may cause a person to develop a yeast infection. Honey is also sticky, not slippery, so it would be counterproductive in other ways.

the steelers because the logo was just temp, they didn't know if they would like the steelmark, after it replaced the players numbers on either side of the gold helmet, Jack hart (equip manager) insisted on leaving it on one side of the gold helmet, then they finished second for eastern conference, qualified for playoff bowl, they wanted to do something special for postseason game, so they changed the color of helmet to black from gold, which highlighted the new logo. since then the logo only on one side brought on a lot of interest, and b/c of the teams success after that they decided to leave it that way
In the old days, before the early 20th century, red was the brightest color of paint readily available --- aside from white (which, technically, is not a color but you art majors can handle this aspect).\nAnyway, most paint was available in white, red, green or blue. Other colors such as tan or orange were available but more expensive to produce.\nThese were the days before large chemical firms, when small companies produced only a few colors of paint. If you wanted light blue walls in your study, you mixed white and blue --- you didn't buy light blue.\nRed showed the best on water and was readily available. When undisturbed, the bobber's top is red. If you get a nibble, the fish typically turns the bobber over and you can see the white bottom.\nAnyone who has ever tried to see a bobber against an evening sun knows how difficult it can be to see white in the sparkling water. The red helps, a bit.\nIt's more tradition than anything that keeps bobbers red and white today. Lime green or orange would be better, and I have seen these colors on bobbers.\nBut there's something comforting about a red and white bobber. It's an historical link to the past.
Chemical engineering is the application of science, in particular chemistry, physics and mathematics, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms.\n\nChemistry (derived from alchemy) is the science of matter at or near the atomic scale. In this pursuit chemistry deals with the properties of such matter, the transformations of matter and the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. \n\nEXAMPLE: \n\nThe difference between chemical engineering and chemistry can be illustrated by considering the example of producing orange juice. A chemist working in the laboratory investigates and discovers a multitude of pathways to extract the juice of an orange. The simplest mechanism found is to cut the orange in half and squeeze the orange using a manual juicer. A more complicated approach found is to peel and then crush the orange and collect the juice. A company then commissions a chemical engineer to design a plant to manufacture several thousand tons of orange juice per year. The chemical engineer investigates all the available methods for making orange juice and evaluates them according to their economical viability. Even though the manual juicing method is simple, it is not economical to employ thousands of people to manually juice oranges. Thus another, cheaper method is used (possibly the 'peel and crush' technique). The easiest method of manufacture on a laboratory bench will not necessarily be the most economical method for a manufacturing plant.

I have a huge problem with that. I also have a problem with people expecting you to change your plans to accommodate them. I just refuse to do it anymore. If I were you I would tell the person/people when they come over "I'm sorry, we were just on our way out. I'll call you later OK?" That way you're rid of them, and maybe they'll get the hint without you having to come out and call them on coming over unannounced and uninvited. Hope this helps...

Look at their division. With the World Champion White Sox, the contending Indians, and the somehow best record Tigers, how do you look good? The only weak team in the division are the Kansas City Royals, and they are barely a team. Plus, they lost Jaque(sp?) Jones. I think that if the Twins were in a different division, they would look much better than they do now.
Aliens are not going to arrive, so there is no worry about them proving anything. The "Anthropic Principle" proves that the universe is fine-turned for intelligent life to be on earth and no where else in the universe. We know for sure there is no intelligent life as far out as 230 light-years. From 230 light-years away, it would take a spacecraft traveling at 7 million miles per hour, 23,000 years to get here, if it were able to miss all the space junk and the fuel and craft and beings didn't expire.

To help vomit up poison, ipicac syrup is needed. However, why do you want to vomit? Voluntary vomiting is not good for you, and it sounds like you should consult a doctor.
Most doctors, if not all, say exercise is good; however, by changing your eating habits, your weight (stomach) will go down and you could probably get away with doing alot less crunches (yuck!) I ate more protein (chicken, fish), green veggies, lots of water, limited carbohydrates (go online or get a book) and continued running (not as much as you), and have kept my weight off and have done so since I had my twins 28 years ago. Congrats on your commitment to running...it's cool to get that second wind and makes you feel like you could run forever and ever. However, over the years (unfortunately it has been several), I have found that once you stop exercising, fat sure starts coming on quicker than if you hadn't exercised at all. I picked Yoga and Pilates (bad back) and it has been quite successful. You are 17 right now, get your body back by changing your eating habits and continuing to exercise (just don't get carried away if you know what I mean) and your weight and stomach will both start showing improvement more quickly than you could imagine. The good news is that your skin is still able to bounce back and hopefully you will avoid those awful stretchmarks. Like I said previously, I had twins at 22, went over 200 lbs when I delivered, and can honestly say I do not have any stretchmarks, do not eat diet or no fat foods (again, yuck!) and my body looks pretty good for being in my 50's. Another word of caution....understand the meaning of MODERATION. It's all part of the life cycle. Good Luck.
He's got more pull with the horses than most jockeys do! He is a gifted person & that makes him a target of the so-called "dark side" of the racing industry. He only listens to what is real.

He can't be bought or bullied into submission & for that, he is held in high regard by the rest of the working class on the backlot of the track.

My brother-in-law had a huge piece of metal dropped on the back of his foot at work. After the bruises healed, he learned his heel spurs had been broken up by the injury.\n\nWhile a true story, I wouldn't recommend that strategy. Try drinking Emergen-C with MSM 2 or 3 times a day. It is a powdered drink you can buy in any good health food store or online. It doesn't taste bad at all...kind of like a slightly salty fizzy lemondae. A doctor friend of mine recommends it to his patients and has known it to resolve heel spurs (among other things).

Rey Mysterio hes so cute and tiny and is really nice
nah....elizabethtown is pretty good. its from the same guy who did almost famous, cameron crowe, and i would say its typical of his movies. they're all a little longer than they 'could' be, but you can't think of exactly what you'd cut out because its all good. i enjoyed it, and i think thats saying something because i kind of think orlando bloom is kind of a douche. he fits the pirates and LOTR and THATS ABOUT IT because hes not the best actor. and in response to the other person....garden state was WONDERFUL and should NOT be compared to this movie. same genre....completely different. thats like saying gone in 60 seconds and armageddon are the same movie because they contain a lot of action where one family member is sticking up for another. you shouldn't overgeneralize
because you afraid of rejection, which is completely normal. just feel the other person out and see if you can tell how they would react to what you need and want to say and then find the right moment and just say it.

If you are a man, start with the KISS TEST. Touch her hair (like a couple of strands hanging in the front or something not creepy) and say something nice about it like: I like your hair, or your hair is so soft. If she is open to this and seems to like it then she is open to a kiss. Go for it. If you don't kiss her on the first date, you are likely to get the "We are just friends" disease.
That's a gigantic question -- these days, "alternative medicine" seems to run the gamut from "anything your insurance doesn't cover" to snake oil & superstition.\n\nThe only risk that holds true for the entire range, I suppose, is that your insurance company probably won't cover it. Some do, though, which has been nice to see.

The BSE Sensex or BSE Sensitive Index is a value-weighted index composed of 30 companies with the base April 1979 = 100. It consists of the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks, representative of various sectors, on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The set of companies in the index is essentially fixed. These companies account for around one-fifth of the market capitalization of the BSE.\n\nThe SENSEX, short form of the BSE-Sensitive Index, is a "Market Capitalization-Weighted" index of 30 stocks representing a sample of large, well-established and financially sound companies. It is the oldest index in India and has acquired a unique place in the collective consciousness of investors. The index is widely used to measure the performance of the Indian stock markets. SENSEX is considered to be the pulse of the Indian stock markets as it represents the underlying universe of listed stocks at The Stock Exchange, Mumbai. Further, as the oldest index of the Indian Stock market, it provides time series data over a fairly long period of time (since 1978-79).\n\nFor a in depth understanding, visit http://www.tradersedgeindia.com/bse_sens...

Cloture is a parliamentary procedure by which debate is ended and an immediate vote is taken on the matter under discussion.\n\nIf HIMMA is enacted, it would allow insurers to offer health plans that are exempt from state consumer protection laws, including mental health parity, psychology “freedom of choice,” mental health benefit mandates and mandated offering laws. \n\nWithout these state requirements insurers would be able to offer “barebones plans.” The only condition is that they also offer employers an alternative plan based on the state employee benefits in one of the five most populous states, which could also be “barebones.” As a result, the benefits in the alternative plan may still be inadequate.

The Enola Gay is at the Smithsonian Institute. It is the most photographed airplane ever. Do some YAHOO! searches to discover the value of your "hidden camera" photos. Be prepared to document proof that your grandfather served at the base where the photos were taken (DD214 duty assignments, pay slips, etc.). Sworn testimonials, documentations and so forth. You cannot determine the value of anything without doing research, then the value is determined by what someone is willing to pay and what someone is willing to accept. Another source of internet research is AUCTION HOUSES. Otherwise, anyone who blindly gives you an "educated guess" as a quick answer for 2 points needs educating himself. Good research is your answer.
>>>Can we see any other way than digital?\n\nThe only way we can see is analogue. Human vision is totally anlogue. It is not digital.\n\n>>> Can we see things that aren't digital?\n\nYes, everyhting we see is analogue.\n\n\n\nThe only way you could possibly stretch a description of human vision to say that it is digital is to invoke the fact that the neurons work on an all-or-none system. The inidvidual neurons are effectively digital.\n\nHowever a single neuron will not produce vison, or any reponse at all, in the brain. Vison is only possible by the intersction of thousands of such neurons, and that interaction is entirley analogue.\n\nHumans do not and can not see in a digital manner. Our eyes and brain are both analogue machines.

VUL is not worth it. Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool. Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection. VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.\n\nThe admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments). With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.\n\nYou have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments. Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.\n\nIsn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk? VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation. If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL. If you can afford it, go with Whole life. It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it.

Tough call. Dealing with schoolyard bullies is one of the hardest things to learn. You _should_ talk to a teacher. The bully will see that as weakness. Bullies are usually stupid and feel inferior and have no good tools for dealing with life. Try to understand. Above all, don't lose your self respect. If you decide to fight, give no warning, just paste him as soon as he starts to hassle you. But be aware that most schools will discipline both parties in a fight, because there is no place for violence in schools. So the first thing to do is talk to a teacher or principal.
Just let her know your there for her, if shes got nothing else your obviously a good friend and a good start! If your still in school talk to a counselor for her if she won't help herself you can remain anonymous and they will talk to her about her problems and put her in touch with the people she needs to fix her family situation (social services, police, etc.). I've listed a site below as my source with number so suicide hotlines please give these to her.

It's NEVER over until your dead. So, ask yourself a question, "Is he worth all this time, thinking, and heartache?" If the answer is yes, then your answer is simple...do whatever it takes to improve your current relationship and start working on the things you do that really irritates him and if you don't know what irritates him, then there's your problem. You guys definitely need to work on your communication skills because, if you don't--then this relationship is destined to fail. \n\nTips for improving this up-and-down relationship: first make a list of the most important things to you (and then a list of which of those things is most lacking in your relationship). Then start thinking of ways to improve these areas of critical need (brain-storming). And most IMPORTANTLY--start communicating with your potential husband. This is critical and if you can't start talking about these issues then things will NEVER get better!!! Good luck and keep working on fixing this relationship because this guy seems to be the key to your happiness.

Yes, that is abusive behavior, and hitting "things" is what Domestic Abuse experts call "Furniture violence" and it's considered a huge red flag...\nWas there anything that seems to have triggered the change?

I am a Real Estate Broker in Oregon and there is NO reason why the buyer should ever see what you owe on the home. However a tax search can be pulled by anyone and that will tell the person doing the search what the amount of the last loan was and when(unless something has changed recently because tax searches on the internet are usually upto 6 months behind). Any agent or broker has the access to see what the taxes are on any property in the state which they are licensed in. Good Luck!!

Until recently it was WWE because of the Superior graphics and roster, now all of the older wrestlers are leaving either cos there injured or because they haven't been given any real title chances. Vince has concentrated on the wrestlers he already had rather than bringing in new talent. John Cena was a panic buy, lets face it the only reason he was brought in so fast was because the story lines where getting stale. TNA is now the best place to watch true wrestling talent and anyone who doesn't think so needs to watch The Bound For Glory pay per view line up. There wrestlers are allowed to create new moves and be daring which is far more entertaining than watching yet another overly muscular wrestler from the WWE fight another overly muscular wrestler. TNA build up story lines and keep them going.\n\nI have to say after been a fan of WWE for over 10 years i am disappointed with their latest offerings.

I'm pretty sure you mean Johannes Evangelista Purkinje. He was Professor of Physiology at the University of Prague, where he discovered the phenomenon known as the Pukinje effect (as light intensity decreases, red objects are perceived to fade faster than blue objects of the same brightness). \n\nHe is best known for his discovery, in 1837, of Purkinje cells, large nerve cells with many branching extensions found in the cortex of the cerebral cortex. He is also known for his 1839 discovery of Purkinje fibers, the fibrous tissue that conducts the pacemaker stimulus along the inside walls of the ventricles to all parts of the heart. Purkinje introduced the scientific terms plasma, to describe the clear liquid remaining after blood has been cleared of it’s various corpuscle components, and protoplasm, used to describe young animal embryos. \n\nPurkinje was the first to use the microtome (to slice thin tissue sections), glacial acetic acid, potassium bichromate and Canada balsam in the preparation of tissue samples for microscopic examination. Purkinje described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpintine on humans in 1829. An early user of the improved compound microscope, he discovered the sweat glands of the skin in 1833, germinal vessicles in 1825, recognized fingerprints as a means of identification in 1823 and noted the protein-digesting power of pancreatic extracts in 1836. \n\nJohannes Evangelista Purkinje was a pioneer to experimental physiology whose investigations in the fields of histology, embryology and pharmacology helped to create a modern understanding of the eye and vision, brain and heart function, mammalian reproduction and the composition of cells.

Metallic mercury is not very hazardous. However, it gives off mercury vapor and long exposure to it is harmful. You should do your best to clean up the mercury, but the amount in a single thermometer is not worrisome.\n\nUse steel wool to absorb the mercury. Wrap it in several layers of plastic or newspaper and dispose of it with your household trash. Although mercury is hazardous waste, household hazardous waste is exempt from regulation.
Myoflex, Blue Goo, are both more powerful, but if you are also looking for something that doesn't smell like medicine you should try Arnica.

NYT Headline:\n\n"Scorpion is a Moron"\n\n\nWait, that's not news at all.
1.2 million are tossed- but everyone I know saves them in a jar, and once a year, they put it toward their vacation! It is not alot but is adds up! If you don't want them for yourself, give them to a charity or something- there are a million causes that would not care if they got pennies. Who are we that we can toss pennies away- giive to someone who needs it!\n\nanother tidbit of info for you:\n\nFrom the following website: WWW.TREASURY.GOV--\n\nAre there any plans to remove the one-cent coin (more popularly known as the "penny”) from circulation?\n\n You may be interested to know that the penny is the most widely used denomination currently in circulation and it remains profitable to make. Significantly, it is Congress that determines the denominations of coins that the Mint must produce and put into circulation. Each penny costs .81 of a cent to make, but the United States Mint collects one cent for it. The profit goes to help fund the operation of the United States Mint and to help pay the public debt. In 2000, this profit added up to about $24 million. As the United States Mint produces the coins that Congress mandates, it does not have the authority to abolish a unit of currency. If directed to do so by legislation enacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the Treasury Department would again study phasing out the penny. Because the demand exists and the Federal Reserve Banks require inventories to meet the demand, the United States Mint is committed to producing the penny.
You can exchange them back from the bank. I think that they're insured for loss, and so on. Take them to the bank on a day when the dollar is higher in value...you know, a bigger bang for the buck! ;) Cheers

IMO this is one of the ways our body is built to be adaptive. For people who are exposed to a constant need to lift heavy objects, the body sends a message to the bone cells to add more bone to handle the extra demand that they will need.\n\nAnother example of this adaptivity is modifying the metabolism to use fewer calories when experiencing a famine and keeping this change after the famine ends.\n\nUnfortunately for us modern folk who never experience famine unless we are dieting, this makes losing weight even harder!
It's likely you will have to re-Install all the programs again from scratch. You can use the cd's that came with the programs and in a lot of cases you can go to the programs web page and download the drivers from their site. Don't forget to go to windows.com and run the update as most programs have new drivers.\n\nWhen you re-install windows, the Registry is cleaned out (Good and Bad)...each program has to "register" with windows before it runs the program. Hope that helped?
Yes. AVG slows down our computer because it would tempt to open up a popup beside the taskbar to inform us that we have a virus detected. That popup is heavy duty unlike with Norton antivirus which is simple and lighweight to use. Other than slowing down our PC, it can't even protect us from newly created viruses such as brontoks. They are not providing real-time virus definition updates. But if you prefer a free antivirus software then Avast is your choice :)

Yes, it would be worth it!\nEven if you don't want to advance in your career and are happy where you are, getting your degree is obviously on your mind. It's a goal of yours, and I think you sound like you would be proud of it if you accomplished it. It probably can't hurt anything to go back and work for something if it is important to you. Good luck!
Reading will definitely help, especially if it is from a variety of writers, genres and time periods. Word of the day type things work for some people, but others totally blow it off. I had a teacher once who gave us extra credit for finding Vocabulary/ Word of the Day words in our books. You could do something similar for students who take the time to learn a random word from the dictionary well enough to use it, or teach it to the class.

With the flu spreading around the world, the virus has turned up in birds in Asia and Europe, and it is feared that migrating flocks could take it to the Middle East and Africa. So far, the bird flu has only been passed from birds, either to other birds or in the isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\n\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes, and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\n\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus.
Everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nIf it is true, as I believe, that those who are gay/lesbian are born that way, then it would be logical that a 6 year old could be gay. Whether they personally would know this at such an age, I don't know. It seems that 6 is a bit young to have a grasp of what we adults refer to as "sexual orientation," tho kids do have their own age-appropriate "sexuality."
I do. Variety is wonderful. :)
Wha? Biologically a girl becomes a woman when she starts menstrating. If you are talking about the hymen, it usually breaks when she has sex for the first time but not necessarily, mine did from riding horses. You may be able to tell if she "still a girl" if she's really tight and it hurts her when you penetrate, but probably not.
Have you ever peed before? If so, and it has always burned, yes. If this is a *new* condition then your sister must have given you something she caught from your dad. You'd better cut it off before you accidentally breed.

You are just seeing things on one side. See, God uses the bad that people do for good. Judas intentions were not to glorify the Christ but his intentions were to "get rich" The Jewish counsel's intentions were not to carry out the redemption of man by putting Jesus on the cross, their intention was to silence this man who said He was God. Juda realized that Jesus was who He said He was in the garden, that is why he hung himself.

I used to be a server and sometimes I think you are working with a bunch of angry people that hate their job and are only there cause they feel the have to be and have no drive to do anything else. Being a server is a hard job, but it can also be a fun job that some people make a lot of money at if they are in the right location (upscale casual to upscale... no chains).\n\nMy advice to you is to make sure that your customers are happy and take care of the needs in your section and help out when you can. And of course, make sure that you keep your managers happy. Screw those bad temper chicks. If they are always constantly in the weeds and don't know how to consolidate to take care of their tables than they need to ask for smaller sections. BE SURE... not sacrifice the level of service that you give to your customers to help them if they don't appreciate it. This hurts your tips. \n\nBy the way, you may be too nice. They may be walking over you because they feel they can. And if you help them, make sure they help you.\n\nAlso, when you are giving your tables good service, their guest will notice and those people will start to ask for you cause they always see you taking care of your guest.\n\nAs far as they one that call you a name, she is just insecure and was probably out of meds that day.\n\nNow go earn that 20% tip.\n\n:)
Good advice is always certain to be ignored, but that's no reason not to give it.
First, don't listen to these smart-ass people bein' rude to you. Second, i would recommend that you go to a health clinic and tell them that you haven't had your period in a few months and they will give u a pill that will make u ovualate. I believe u take it for 10 days so wait about the 6 day to have sex, and if that doesn't work then have yourself checked out to see if you can get pregnant. hope all goes well.....
Some technical elements:\n\n1) Use of deep focus - deep focus allowed the camera to see the background as sharply as the foreground. Welles made good use of this. \n\nFor example, in the scene where Susan tries to kill herself. Welles implies to us what she did in just one shot, because you can see the medicine bottle in the foreground, Susan lying down in the "mid-ground", and the locked door in the background; this all implies that she tried to kill herself. If Welles didn't use deep focus, such a shot (and such economy of shots) would be impossible.\n\n2) Jump cuts - you can see this in the scene where Kane says "Merry Christmas" to Thatcher, then it cuts to a scene many years later, where Thatcher says "And a Happy New Year".\n\nWelles used jump cuts creatively in this film, such as the example above. It is a joy to see how freshly he uses jump cuts (and other techniques) in this film, even though the movie is decades old.\n\nSome symbolism:\n\n1) When came walks past the hall of mirrors, I think the image shows us how many faces Kane had in his life, and which one is the real Kane? Who knows? \n\n2) When the smoke rises to the sky during the last shots of the movie, I think the shot is saying to us "Look... Kane had so much possessions in his life... But so what? All of it is fleeting just like that smoke".

Some impairment of luster possible." - $150\n\nThese are retail prices, so this is what you might expect to pay a coin dealer in order to get one... not necessarily what a dealer might pay to buy one from you, however.

It isn't just the western country economies dependent on it. One of the reason for gas price spikes have been a large increase in dependency from the biggest population countries, China and India. The problem is the entire world is dependent on a very limited supply of product.\nThe Western countries will never be come independent on their own supplies because they don't have enough supply to meet the demand. The only way that will change is if a new fuel supply comes along that is much cheaper and equal to or more efficient than fossil fuels, and it still requires us getting rid of the nearly 1 billion cars in the US currently.

Get out the yellow pages and call companies in your field and ask if you can fax over your resume and to who's attention. You can follow up in a week with a call to that person. Take a look at your resume. Is it full of gobbledegook about you are looking for a meaningful job or discusses your character instead of what work you can do? Employers want to see a specific job objective like to find a sales trainee position where I can use my strong interpersonal skills. Stuff about finding a meaningful job goes in the garbage esp if you can't say what kind of job you are looking for. You should also be telling everyone you knows including relatives that you are looking for a job. Also apply for civil service jobs and look on the websites of the school systems
Your conclusion would give a very brief summary of the most important points you made in your essay and a concluding statement. You may want to restate your opinion in different words - strongly state what you believe. In your conclusion it is always good to strongly state what action you think needs to be taken. If you can find a good quotation that suits, that is a good way to end an essay. You want your conclusion to be memorable. \n\nYou may get an idea at one of these links. I hope this helps.

i don't think you act as mature as you think you do. your question is very 11 year old. instead of saying "i act too mature for my age. I'm only 11.

I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam. Though routines performed on each event may be short, they are physically exhausting and push the gymnast's strength, flexibility, endurance and awareness to th
The seller should still resume sending you your item. If he doesnt, then you can always send in a complaint through ebay and your credit card company to refund you if you do not get your item within 1 month. \n\nYou were too quick to leave a negative feedback. When you leave a negative feedback, you will have to assume you will get one too. Those feedbacks represents your ebay reputation, so you should take that pretty seriously.\n\nUnless the seller refunds you manually, you should still be getting your item.\n\nNOTE: You can always withdraw your feedback by filling in a "feedback withdrawal" form through ebay. That way, both your negative feedbacks will get removed.

I found this on wikipeida:\n\nThe largest concentrations--about 47% of all Muslims in India--live in the 3 states of Bihar (13.7 million) (16.5%), West Bengal (20.2 million) (25%), and Uttar Pradesh (30.7 million) (18.5%), according to the 2001 census. Muslims represent a majority of the local population only in Jammu and Kashmir (67 % in 2001) and Lakshadweep (95 %). High concentrations of Muslims are found in the eastern states of Assam (31 %) and West Bengal (25 %), and in the southern state of Kerala (25 %) and Karnataka (12.2%).

For a lot of reasons. It actually depends on the person involved.\n\nFor one thing, it could be because the person is simply restless in nature. People who belong to this category often are found doing other things besides the one that they are currently working on.\n\nAnother, it is probably because it is a habit that one has developed in the earlier parts of one's life. Pressumably the parents of this person is observed talking on the phone with notepads. In an artistic way, this person is incorporating what his/her subconscious has picked up from her past.\n\nStill, it could be that the person is a workaholic. Someone who falls under this catergory cannot simply focus on doing one task alone. For them, though not really intentionally, talking idly on the phone consumes work time. These are the type of people that cannot keep their hands still, and due to the skill inherent to one person, he begins to multitask. Or in this situation, draw.\n\nLastly, it could simply be because the person is simply... uninterested of the conversation and feels the need to do something other than talking idly on the phone.\n\nOfcourse, there are sometimes where in a person is a combination of these categories. ^^\n\nI hope it helps!

I picked the Mets to win in 2006....I just like their lineup. Starters might not be the greatest but they probably don't have to be. Solid bullpen with Billy Wagner closing things out, a bounce back year from Carlos Beltran, Delgado, Wright and Reyes doing what they normally do and I like the Mets chances. Maybe i'm dreaming too....

I don't know what you mean by "dirty" but once you put it out there you can't take it back. He can't possibly unhear what you've told him. If it's to much for him he'll move on.

Yes, they are legal, and in most cases, they do work, just like any other ringtone, you download them into the phone. However, BEWARE of anything that is free. I do technical support for one of the top three cellular phone companies, and our particular company's policy is to warn our customers about using these websites. For several reasons, one being that when you go to these website, you usually end up getting set up on some kind of monthly alert for new ringtones. They come as text messages, and can cost you as much as $20 a month. Also, your cell phone company should have a homepage, and links to downloads from that homepage. Only those links from that home page are safe and protected from virus, worm, etc. If you go to any other site on your phone, you are just as subject to pick up a virus as if you were on a regular pc. I'm not saying they are all bad, of course. Just use caution.

The fact that you mostly see him at work, that is a great opportunity for you. Please don't be too forward with him - like asking him out on a date or telling him straight that you like him. He could be one of the guys that find it a turn-off. Instead try to show more interest in what he does at work, ask him "neutral" questions like: "What challenges are you currently facing here at work?", "What are your future dreams?" After about a month of chatting with him, start buying him lunch (but not too much) maybe once in two weeks, and say "I like this dish so much, I just thought of sharing with you." Be Creative ... good luck!

Some of them are forced to resort back to Filipino language when they don't have the necessary command of further English to complete their sentence...similar to Spanglish.

Yes, SOME believe that, and they can keep on believing it. But if they are basing it on the Mayan Long Count Calendar ending on 12-21-2012, they are basing it on a misunderstanding. The calendar doesn't end. The 12th Baktun ends. That's like our calendar going from 1999 to 2000. The world didn't end then either, so the crazy people found another date to spread fear about-12-21-2012.

Greenwich Village would be in New York so definitely in the Eastern Time Zone. On the other hand, if you mean Greenwich in England then there are two answers. Local time in Greenwich is 8 hours ahead of Pacific Time or 5 hours ahead of Eastern Time (about 9:42 am). However, the Universal Coordinated Time (which timezones are based) is actually an hour earlier. The distinction is that Greenwich is on Daylight Savings Time now, just like the U.S. but UTC does not change. It would be 8:42 am UTC.\n\nGMT and UTC are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same thing between April and October, as you can see. So the question is which one do you truly mean? GMT or UTC?

A side compartment in the "grave" that the wrestler, in this case the Undertaker, rolls into before the dump of dirt. The camera never shows the inside of the grave and therefore fools the audience.

there's a #1 and a #3, but #2, as the compromise candidate, is by far the most common.\n\n#1 pencils have a harder lead, meaning a lighter color and finer line. Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply.
Communism is an economic system, not a system of government.\n\nThe opposite of communism (central/shared ownership) is capitalism (individual ownership). But either could theoretically exist in anything from a democracy to a republic to a monarchy. \n\nDemocracy is straight voter control. All decisions based on individual votes. The US is not a democracy. It is a republic, where we elect people to make laws for us, rather than doing it ourselves.\n\nThe opposite of a democracy is a monarchy, where one person has total control. If that person chooses to ignore the laws of the country with impunity, then it becomes a tyranny.\n\nBut it's mix-and-match how you combine economic systems, which determine how property is owned, with government systems, which determine how laws are made.

The Socs are like the towns good two shoes but in disquise they are really dirt they do more bad things then the greasers do. Greasers like to fight fair but the Socs always pulls out switch blades.

Socs think they are better then anyone in the world they think they can get anything or anyone. Greasers just be themselfs they dont go around jumping people for the fun of it like the Socs. The only reasons they are really bad is to live. They steal because they cant afford those things. Socs steal because its fun even thought they have enought money.

I don't know of any state that automatically gives the spouse of a convict a waiver of court costs; however, every state does have a method for obtaining a waiver of court costs by persons who have low incomes. Check with your local court to find out what the schedule is.\n\nStates do not supply attorneys to divorce litigants, so your choice is to hire counsel, try to find free counsel, or do it yourself. Most local bar associations have referral services including referrals to attorneys who have agreed to take some cases for free or on a sliding scale.

Two, actually- One was a simple water heater for a cabin of mine, using a rooftop black insulated tub with a large clear cover-the sun heated the water, and I was able to take a warm shower at night- The other was a triple paned greenhouse made out of 3mm plastic- It was an experiment I did to see how long I could keep a greenhouse going in the winter here in Manitoba. The cost of either was negligible.
Too many. If u onsider the mechanical relays and valve elements -they will run into millions.
The RNC doesn't trust McCain no matter how he cravenly panders to them. The RNC won't back him in 2008. They'll look to someone who can reach their neo-con base. And McCain is a pariah among the neo-cons.

Liver and Kidney Yin Vacuity \nThis pattern appears as the combined Yin deficient symptoms of both the Liver and Kidney, and is common in depleted or older patients. Aging, reproduction, and excessive sexual activity deplete the Kidney, while the stresses of life and emotional challenges tax the Liver. Together, the diminishment of these two vital substances is responsible for numerous natural phases such as menopause, and the overall aging process. Deficient Yin of these combined organs will result in dryness of all their associated bodily tissues, including the skin, hair, eyes, and diminishment of sexual fluids. As the Liver rules the eyes, visual problems such as loss of acuity, blurry vision and dry eyes result. As the Kidneys rule the ears hearing problems, such as tinnitus or hearing loss develop. Other symptoms include dizziness, dry mouth and throat, seminal emission, insomnia, and low back or knee ache. Also included will be heat signs due to Empty Fire rising out of Yin vacuity, such as warmth in the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the chest center. The tongue will be red, possibly with cracking, and have little coating. The pulse will be fine and weak.

No, there is not one website with all of the laws. http://www.findlaw.com comes close, http://thomas.loc.gov/ has quite a few, Cornell Law School has compiled a bunch, http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/. With all of the various state laws, trying to query them would be difficult, even with just federal laws, there are too many to put in one place. You didn't even ask about administrative rules, procedural rules, etc. There are just too many.
where do these people get their info? The "cherry" as it is referred to by many, is actually the hyman (not positive about the spelling) This is a thin piece of skin up inside the vagina. A woman is considered a "virgin" as long as this skin is intact. A virgin's cherry has been "popped" when she has intercourse for the first time and this skin is broken by the insertion of the male's penis. It is also possible for a virgin to break this seal during the use of tampons. Hoped this has helped

Jewish political power in America is unassailable, as it had become in Germany before Hitler. Hitler's solution was the only answer there and then. It resulted in what he called the Jewish War - WW11. Because he lost that war, everything he said is now called wrong. In time, history will vindicate his opinions, unless politically correct hypocrisy succeeds in permanently smothering the truth, as it has done up to now.\nThe terrible mess in Iraq, called a war, is very certainly a Jewish war. Israel is the one and only country which benefits from it and it was Israel which caused it - or, for the benefit of the brain-dead majority who will read this, the American support of Israel. It was, dear dumbos, this support which turned the Islamic world against America, culminating in 9/11, which in turn caused the Iraq attack.

Get a new motherboard for your pc would be the best bet
It all really depends on what type of application has the port open. For instance, if you are running a web server you would most likely see port 80 and perhaps 443 for a secure web site. If you had an FTP server running, you would see port 21 open. To gain access to these various ports, it is best to use the application intended (ie. Web browser, FTP client, etc.) If you want to make a raw connection to an open port you can sometimes uses the telnet protocol and add the port number to the end. Drop to DOS and type 'telnet <ip# of computer w/open port> <port#>' like this: 'telnet 127.0.0.1 25' This would connect you to a SMPT server running on your local computer (port# 25).
Eventually you'll find a woman where you'll find yourself thinking "Hey wait just a cotton-pickin minute....she doesn't have all of the traits I want in a woman, and by golly I love her anyway". You'll find that with enough time and with the right person your 'laundry list' will lessen and the things that TRULY matter will surface. (Just be careful to not let them get lost again when you get comfortable in the relationship)\nAnd by the way.....if you don't want more children that isn't selfish, and the right woman won't care and will support your decisions and accept your 6 year old and love him as her own.

Almost all the invertabrates are edible-and most are eaten by one culture or another, but lets assume you are making a menu for an American group- Common inverts that the average American would eat would include clams, scallops, lobster, crab, maybe escargot (snails), calimari (squid), shrimp, all sorts of mussels, especially in soup.\nMore exotic, but still found in Western countries would be, for example, chocolate-covered ants, sea urchin, octopus (especially in sushi). \nIn a lot of countries, fried large grubs are eaten, worms, any sort of insect. The one class of invert that is rarely eaten are the spiders, centipedes, millipede family, because they are often toxic or carry parasites that can infect people.

Aruba's currency is the guilder / florin denoted by the letters 'Awg.' but also widely known as 'Afl.' The official rate at which banks accept U.S. dollar banknotes is Awg. 1,77 and checks at Awg. 1,78. The rate of exchange granted by shops and hotels ranges from Awg. 1,75 to Awg. 1,80 per U.S. dollar. U.S. Dollars are widely accepted in Aruba, and banks may exchange other foreign currency.\n\nTraveler's checks are widely accepted and there is no charge for using them in hotels, restaurants and stores. Major credit cards are accepted at most establishments while personal checks are normally not accepted. \n\nThe Aruban florin is divided into 100 cents and there are coins of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, 1 florin (100 cents) as well as the 5 florin coin. The square shaped 50 cent "yotin" coin is probably Aruba's best-known coin. \n\nBanknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 florins. Many souvenirs are made with the square 50 cent coin while the coin itself makes a unique gift for numismatic friends.\n\nCash may be obtained with MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards at credit card offices, banks, in some casinos and via Western Union. ATM cards and credit cards are accepted by ATMs of Aruba Bank, Banco di Caribe, RBTT Bank, and Caribbean Mercantile Bank. The card must have either a Cirrus or Visa Plus logo. ATM instructions are normally given in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento. Cash is normally dispensed in local currency.\n\nTravelers with ATM cards bearing the CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Plus System network logos can withdraw cash in Aruban florins. Home bank accounts will be debited in dollars at a favorable exchange rate, and a 1% - 3% service charge will apply, depending on your credit card company. Before departing for Aruba, it's important to verify whether your PIN number will work in Aruba by calling 1-800-4-CIRRUS\n\nAruba is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone. You didn’t say what time zone you are in (Indiana is in two time zones). If you’re in the Eastern time zone, Aruba is one hour ahead.\n\nPersons planning to visit Aruba as a tourist for a period not exceeding 90 days for the purpose of recreation, sports, health, family reasons, study, religious purposes or business must submit the following documentation:\n\n·A U.S. passport.\n·The necessary documents for returning to the country of origin (valid permanent resident document)\n·Proof of sufficient funds to stay in Aruba;\n·Return or onward ticket and other documents required for the next destination (visa etc.).\n\nNon-compliance with one of the above mentioned documentations might result in refusal of entry to Aruba. The immigration of Aruba based on the funds the tourist is traveling with shall determine the period of stay in Aruba.\n\nTo: Miss Demanda,\n\nHow many people are missing or killed here in the U.S. every year? Should all foreigners stay away from the U.S.? \n\nHere is a quote from an MSNBC news article on Natalee Holloway:\n\nViolent crime is virtually unheard of here. Last year there were two murders, I believe, and those were considered to be drug related and that was it. There were maybe six rapes. When you are talking about an island nation with so many visitors, that is considered an extremely low crime rate.

Yes I have from time to time. The first thing I would do is get a complete physical including a testosterone level. Many things can cause a decrease in libido such as over work, financial problems, court appearances, and a partner who is super critical of everything such as my ex wife. All of us men go through periods such as you describe but eventually the interest returns. If it doesn't, I would not worry if I was you because the more you think your not interested the more you won't be. Also, libido varies a great deal from person to person so enjoy the lack of stress that a low one gives you. If you're single, think of all the money you'll save. Good luck!

Some of the most common mistakes employers make concern inquiries into an applicant's medical history--such as asking whether the applicant ever filed a worker's compensation or disability claim or has ever been hospitalized, and if so, for what condition. The Americans With Disabilities Act strictly prohibits employers from asking applicants any questions that would reveal whether an applicant has a mental or physical disability. Employers should provide the applicant with the essential job functions of the position applied for and inquire whether the applicant can perform those essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.

No, Bush did not deceive the American people. Please consider the following information as reference:\n\nIraqis can participate in three historic elections, pass the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and form a unity government despite terrorist attacks and provocations. Yet for some critics of the president, these are minor matters. Like swallows to Capistrano, they keep returning to the same allegations--the president misled the\ncountry in order to justify the Iraq war; his administration\npressured intelligence agencies to bias their judgments; Saddam Hussein turned out to be no threat since he didn't possess weapons of mass destruction; and helping democracy take root in the Middle East was a postwar rationalization. The problem with these charges is that they are false and can be shown to be so--and yet people continue to believe, and spread, them. Let me examine each in turn:\n\nThe president misled Americans to convince them to go to war. "There is no question [the Bush administration] misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq," according to Ted Kennedy. Jimmy Carter charged that on Iraq, "President Bush has not been honest with the\nAmerican people." And Al Gore has said that an "abuse of the truth" characterized the administration's "march to war." These charges are themselves misleading, which explains why no independent body has found them credible. Most of the world was operating from essentially\nthe same set of assumptions regarding Iraq's WMD capabilities. Important assumptions turned out wrong; but mistakenly relying on faulty intelligence is a world apart from lying about it.\n\nLet's review what we know. The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the intelligence community's authoritative written judgment on specific national-security issues. The 2002 NIE provided a key\njudgment: "Iraq has continued its [WMD] programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of U.N. restrictions; if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade."\n\nThanks to the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission, which\ninvestigated the causes of intelligence failures in the run-up to the war, we now know that the President's Daily Brief (PDB) and the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief "were, if anything, more alarmist and less nuanced than the NIE" (my emphasis). We also know that the intelligence in the PDB was not "markedly different" from that given to Congress. This helps explains why John Kerry, in voting to give\nthe president the authority to use force, said, "I believe\nthat a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security." It's why Sen. Kennedy said, "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." And it's why Hillary Clinton said in 2002, "In the four years since the inspectors, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild\nhis chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program."\n\nBeyond that, intelligence agencies from around the globe believed Saddam had WMD. Even foreign governments that opposed his removal from power believed Iraq had WMD: Just a few weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom, Wolfgang Ischinger, German ambassador to the U.S., said, "I think all of our governments believe that Iraq has produced\nweapons of mass destruction and that we have to assume that they continue to have weapons of mass destruction."\n\nIn addition, no serious person would justify a war based on\ninformation he knows to be false and which would be shown to be false within months after the war concluded. It is not as if the WMD stockpile question was one that wasn't g

When you filled out the fasta form , the school gets the information for example if you are staying in the dorms etc.... What happens is that the school will send you out a letter with all the grants/ loans/ work study etc on it. You have to send it back to the University on whether you accept the package or accept the package with these changes or deny it completely. Along with this is a promissory note saying that if you take out the loans that you will pay them back. ( my daughter calls this signing your life away) Books, living expenses, tuition fees are all part of the package. And the University gets the check first , takes out the tuition and fees and dorm fees if you are staying on campus and it sends you the rest usually right before the start of classes So you can buy books etc. Books will give you a minor stroke when you see how expensive they are. And if you get work study try to get in your department in which your major is.. My daughter learned allot of things seeing profs outside of class and it helped her network within the school of engineering. Best of luck to you.

Employers cover only a portion of unemployment. The remainder is covered by the Federal government and the state. This safety net helps hundreds of thousands of workers each year who are laid off with no prospect of a new job. One of them was my father in the year 1972. Another was me in the 80's. Another was my sister's husband in the 90's.\n\nSometimes, we pay for things that we never personally use. That doesn't mean that the thing isn't useful or wise to have paid. I am happy to pay for house insurance; although I hope and pray that I may never need to cash in on the policy. Likewise, I'm happy to pay the unemployment tax, though I hope and pray I never again need to make a claim.

Sure. Try using autoruns as an alternative to the built in configuration utility. It lists all the processes that run at startup, and allows you to enable or disable them.\n\nUse at your own risk. There are things that are supposed to run at startup, and are needed by the system. If you're not sure about something, go online and research it... you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot.
I would talk to the head of Human Resources and tell them that you want the insurance to stop being pulled out of your check until all the paper work is done and tell her you either want a refund on the money that has already been taken or to get additional weeks with nothing taken out to make up for the month and a half worth of payments with no insurance! I would be furious! What are the other employees saying? Maybe you could get a group together. People tend to do things quicker when they have 5 or 6 after them, rather than just one.
You'd have to hire a structural engineer to safely design a bridge for a car. Also, you'd need to have an engineer assign a flow (Q) value for a given rain event based on the 200 acres. The Q is a result of the type of landuse upstream. Then given the dimentions of the channel you'll know how high the water elevation will be given a certain storm event, thus the high of the bridge.\n\nI'd contact the local municipality engineering department to find what the requirements (rain event, freeboard) are for flow and structures. There might also be an easement on the ditch. If that's the case, you might not be able to construct a thing.

Hi - \n\nWell, first, a few facts: Cholesterol in your diet can ONLY come from animal products. So that means meats, seafoods (especially shrimp and shellfish), eggs, dairy, etc. If you limit these foods, and increase your intake of fruits, veggies and whole grains, it's likely you will see a positive result :)\n\nNow, onto your question. It's been seen that niacin can have some lowering effect on cholesterol, and some believe garlic supplements can help (both have mixed results in clinical studies). Either way, nothing over the counter will have nearly the effect that a statin would have.\n\nYour MD or RD will be able to tell you best what will work for you and your lifestyle.

The length of the field (pitch) should be in the range 90-120m (100-130 yards) and the width should be in the range 45-90m (50-100 yards). Anything that falls within those limits is acceptable.\n\nThe only other requirement is that the pitch must be rectangular, meaning it can't be 90 X 90.\n\nSo all fields are (literally) not created equal. I think there's been an effort at standardizing the new fields at 100m (long) X 80m (wide) but I can't give you any more details on that.
I don't say "Oh, my G-d". I also (try!) not to swear. I've had co-workers say they enjoy working with me because my lack of swearing helps them not to swear so much.\nI also don't tell people they are going to Hell. Although I am Jewish, I work for a Christian agency, so the rules are also Christian. We do have Jewish individuals, & I generally get called on to interact with them, as I understand the culture/customs. \nTo me, misusing G-d's name also involves having religious bumper stickers on your car while driving like you're late! It means acting arrogantly while telling people how godly you are. I think it means diffeent things to different people.

Diagnosed with cancer nine years ago, Mr. T. has never once asked God to remove the disease. Instead, he has only prayed that God would give him the strength to endure it so he can bless other people. Like Job in the Bible, Mr. T. has come to a place where he looks to God and says, “I trust and praise you in the midst of all this.” Not exactly what you would expect from a Hollywood celebrity.

if you are trying to teach safe shooting habits \ni would recomend a regular Co2 powered BB pistol. and preferably one with a metal outer caseing.\n\nfor 2 reasons. \n\nfirst if you are teaching them about guns. then it should be a gun.\nAirsoft guns are usually plastic and fire wither plastic pellets or 6mm paintballs. this gives the idea to the kid that it is a toy. and that is a disaster waiting to happen. \n\nif they want to get into the game of airsoft (combat battle game much like paintball. i would recoment that they just get directaly into paintball. the paintball markers are more reliable and last longer. and there are more people that play it. \n\na good recomdation for an airsoft gun pretty much anything made by TIPPMAN pnumatics. they make airsoft, paintball, and a variety of other air powered launchers and machines.
Just be sure to get things like blood pressure checked, eat well, be aware of your own body. Just because it was tested doesn't mean it was safe. How many drugs have you heard of that were pulled off of the market? Don't be afraid, just be cautious.

A thiol is a molecule with a covalently bonded -SH group on it (like an alcohol has a covalently bonded -OH). A thiol is quite nucleophilic (more than oxygen in alcohol); in other words, its an electron-donor (i.e. Lewis base).

I agree with the previous posts...don't know of a way to make it come sooner. For future reference, there is a new birth control pill out called Seasonale (or something similar to that name), and you only have a period four times a year. If you don't want to do that, just take your regular pills, skipping the 7 different colored placebos at the end of the pack, and going directly to a new pack. Using this method, you will skip your period until you take the sugar pills. Granted, it might take your body a little while to adjust to that new routine.

bob --\nPerhaps the confusion is that humans do not understand what Divinity is. Human concepts of Divinity are filtered through the human mind, which is a very limited resource, especially when attempting to comprehend a Being as "so far above us" as Divinity is.
Everyone above is correct, except I do believe that the black hole itself does have infinite gravity (that's the reason the light cannot escape...) because the warping of space-time is infinite at the point of infinite density.
Evil doesn't come from anywhere, as it does not exist as a material thing, just as darkness does not exist as a material thing. Darkness is merely the lack of the presence of light, and evil is the lack of the presence of God and his goodness.

a. f'(x) = (4/3)x^(1/3)+(4/3)*x^(-2/3) = 0 for x = -1. This is the only point where the tangent is horizontal.\nb. from a. f'(x) = infinite for x = 0 making the tangent vertical.\nc. from a. follows the extreme max/min at x = -1. Since f''(x) = (1/3)x^(-2/3) - (2/3)x^(-5/3) = 1 > 0 for x = -1 the extreme at x = -1 is minimum.\nd. Since within the given interval the function is final and has only one minimum that is not at the end of the interval the function is concave downward (I would say upward) meaning from f(-8) = 8 monotonically decreases to the minimum f(-1) = -3 and monotonically increases again to f(8) = 24 which is then absolute maximum..\n\nn.b. you can go to excell and plot the function.

congratulations on your laptop. Having your own laptop is fun. Finding internet access is easy: a good source is looking in the yellow pages (if you are in the USA) for internet provider listings. A lot are advertised on the TV and have 800 numbers to call, some are offered by the phone company such as AT&T ; AOL; Earthlink, Netzero, Yahoo, Peoplepc, etc. You will need a basic server: most come preloaded on the laptop--mind did and it is Microsoft Internet Explorer. You need a server to get on the internet and then one of the on-line providers listed above. I am not sure of what you would do if you are from a country other than the USa, BUT Dell could let you know what is available where you are. Best wishes

Danville was settled and named by Americans drawn here by the California Gold rush. Daniel and Andrew Inman bought 400 acres of Old Town Danville with their mining earnings in 1854, after living here for a summer two years earlier. By 1858, the community boasted a blacksmith, a hotel, a wheelwright and a general store and the townsfolk wanted a post office.\n\n"But what should the community be called? In an article years later, Dan Inman said "quite a number (of names) were suggested." He and Andrew rejected "Inmanville," finally settling on Danville. According to the modest Dan, the name was chosen as much or more out of respect for Andrew's mother-in-law who was born and raised near Danville, Kentucky. Of course it also recognized the energetic young Dan who was later an Alameda County Assemblyman and Supervisor."

There's a difference between showing children different lifestyles and religions and forcing one to practice one. There's nothing wrong with that picture. What if your child were forced to perform Muslim prayers everyday as a practicing Christian? If a parent can't handle their child being taught tolerance, which leads to acceptance and peace, then the parent should remove their child from school and home school them.

No, the Internet is not only a way to cheat. In terms of education, it can allow a child whose parents did not go to college an even break with those who do.\nThis is a new form of communication and sharing. It has little to do with inertial systems in the past which tended not to equalize, but to set peoples apart.

First Balance the formula and make a formula:\n\nF2(g) + 2Na(s)------------------- 2NaF(s)\n\nAtomic Mass Na(s): 22.99g/mol\n\n0.56gNa * 1mol/22.99gNa= 0.0244 mol Na\n\nSince 13.8 kJ evolved from 0.0244mol Na divide them together to obtain Kj/mol\n\ntherefore 13.8Kj/0.0244mol= 566 Kj/mol Na\n\n\nNow using the chemical coefficent from the balanced equation turn it into the stadard enthalpy of NaF.\n\n566 Kj/mol Na * 2 mol NaF(s)/2mol Na(s)= 566 Kj/mol NaF(s)\n\nSince they used the term evolved in the question it means it is exothermic and threfore the stadard heat of formation of NaF(s) is negative ( -566 Kj/mol NaF(s))

s = sales\nc = commision\n\nc = s * (20/100) = .20s\n\nSo if you mean that he gets a base salary of $1,500 PLUS whatever he earns in commision, then\n\nPay = 1500 + .20s\n\nIf you mean that he gets paid 20% commision, and if the commision isn't at least 1500, then he gets 1500, then\n\nPay = 1500 OR .20s , whichever is higher.\n\n\nIn this case, his commision (c) is\nc = .20 * 6550\nc = 1310\n\nSo his pay is either $1,500 (since 1310 is less than 1500) or $2,810 (1310+1500) depending one which your looking for. The phrasing of your question leaves doubt as to which you're looking for.

A couple years ago, I had a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year because he had developed a serious drug habit and I had a not quite one year old daughter to take care of, and was starting to get my own life together. One day I heard his name on the radio- he had been shot seven times in the back of his head and his body was found in a dumpster outside a recycling plant. I later found out from my daughter's father, who still saw my friend on a pretty regular basis, that two weeks before he was murdered, my friend had become a Christian. The reason he had been killed was because he was trying to get out of his old lifestyle and away from his old friends and start a new life following Christ. His former friends apparently thought he was really just trying to make an excuse to go and tell the police about them and their drug use, so they killed him. From the story I heard of what happened that night, the people who shot him had asked him to go somewhere with him, and he was scared to go because he knew they were up to something. But, despite the fact that he was afraid, I think he was ready to give up his life because he had accepted Jesus as his savior before he died. Chances are, although I can't say for sure, you will not be killed for your faith, but even if you are, you are already ready because of your faith.

You need a thesaurus. If you are doing these evaluations on a word processor, there may even be a thesaurus built in. I find mine even more valuable than my dictionary. \n\nA thesaurus lists a whole bunch of synonyms ["n. equivalent word, parallel word, analogue, equivalent; another name"] and antonyms (opposites; oddly enough, not listed in this one!) of a lot of words. So you write one evaluation and print it, then replace a few words, print out the second one, etc.\n\nGood luck!

Biochemistry is essentially a narrow field of organic chemistry that deals with organic chemistry in living organisms.\n\nIf you like biology and chemistry, are interested in metabolic pathways, the chemistry of biomolecules, or medicine go with biochemistry. If you just like plain old chemistry, then organic chemistry may be the better choice.\n\nThe primary careers in both fields consist of lab work and research, but there are other options out there. If you want to make more money, you'll probably want to look into obtaining an M.A. or PhD. There are jobs for those with a B.S. or B.A., but you aren't going to make a whole lot of money.\n\nI would recommend talking with academic advisors in both fields at the university you will be attending. They can give you information on what classes you'll need to take for each major, possible career paths you can take, and so forth. Once you know the possible career paths, do some research and see what interests you the most.\n\nRemember that the average undergraduate college student changes their major about 4 times. Don't be afraid to dive in to something because you can always change your mind down the road. In the case of organic chemistry and biochemistry, the classes will probably be the same up until your 2nd year anyways.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and make sure you enjoy the field you are in! You'll find college a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable!

Please visit this site, it has more details, i am including some of it here:\n\nThe Pyramids. According to common perception they were built, with the begrudging help of great armies of slaves, by the ancient pharaohs of Egypt as tombs for preserving their royal bodies. Pyramids were meant to be monuments to the pharaoh's greatness, filled with great treasures for the afterlife. To construct these massive shrines, the pharaoh's copied the oldest and largest pyramid of all, the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nBut the Great Pyramid itself contains no pharaoh's body, no treasure chamber, and no treasures. Who, then, designed it and built it? What was its purpose? Let us begin our tour by considering a few basic facts about the Great Pyramid.\n\n\n The Last "Wonder of the World"\n\nThirty times larger than the Empire State Building, the Pyramid's features are so large they can be seen from the Moon.\nIts base covers 13.6 acres (equal to seven midtown Manhatten city blocks), each side being greater than five acres in area.\nA highway lane eight feet wide and four inches thick could be built from San Francisco to New York and put inside the Great Pyramid.\nThe oldest structure in existence, having been started 4,617 years ago, it is the sole remnant of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n Journey to the Center of the Earth\n\nOnly a solid stone mountain could endure the Pyramid's immense weight. And indeed, a flat solid granite mountain happens to be located just beneath the surface of the ground directly under the Pyramid.\nIt is built to face true North.\nThe Pyramid is located at the exact center of the Earth's land mass. That is, its East-West axis corresponds to the longest land parallel across the Earth, passing through Africa, Asia, and America. Similarly, the longest land meridian on Earth, through Asia, Africa, Europa, and Antarctica, also passes right through the Pyramid. Since the Earth has enough land area to provide 3 billion possible building sites for the Pyramid, the odds of it's having been built where it is are 1 in 3 billion.\n Construction Unequaled by Modern Technology\n\nLike 20th century bridge designs, the Pyramid's cornerstones have balls and sockets built into them. Several football fields long, the Pyramid is subject to expansion and contraction movements from heat and cold, as well as earthquakes, settling, and other such phenomena. After 4,600 years it's structure would have been significantly damaged without such construction.\nWhile the bulk of the Pyramid's core was constructed of 4,000- to 40,000-pound blocks of soft limestone, the outer layer of the Pyramid was made of a beautifully bright, protective layer of polished stone. These outer "casing stones" are missing today because about 600 years ago they were stolen by Arabs, (This accounts for the very worn appearance of the Pyramid today, since the inner limestone blocks are not immune to attack by the elements-wind, rain, and sandstrom.) This protective covering was made up of 100-inch-thick, 20-ton block of hard, white limestone, similar to marble but superior in hardness and in durability against the elements.\n\nThe Great Pyramid did not always look as "rough" as it does today.\nOriginally it was encased with a layer of tight-fitting, highly polished 20-ton stone slabs.\n\nThe casing stones, 144,000 in all, were so brilliant that they could literally be seen from the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away. On bright mornings and late afternoons, sunlight reflected by this vast mirrored surface of 5-1/4 acres distinguished the Pyramid as being visible from the moon. (Note: For those interested in possible symbolic significance, in Bible prophecy 144,000 is the number of people-12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel-who are supposed to evangelize the world at the endtime.)\nThe people of the area had viewed the Pyramid and its polished stones with awe for centuries. But when a 13

If you have doubts then you probably shouldn't be with him. Just the fact that he has worked only 2 months out of the 1 1/2 years since graduation tells me he isn't very serious about his own life and expects mom or you to take care of him and his every need.\nTo me he sounds like what is known as a "mama's boy". A "mama's boy" never grows up and will always expect the woman to do everything for him, hence the way he treats his mom. Most likely he will treat you the same way.\nYour guy living at home with mom isn't a bad thing but his not helping her is. I'm grown and still live at home with dad and sister. In my case I work full time, do my own cleaning & laundry, pay my own bills, and help with household expenses.

You assume responsibility for the sin of someone else. You, a sinner, insist upon paying the price for another person's sin, which is not Christ like. A sinner cannot save another sinner. There is no salvation in this poem for you or the suicide victim. Structurally it is good, though. It does express an idea that most people are oppressed by, that the failures of others are somehow their fault.
The problem misleadingly suggests that the amount the three men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($2) SHOULD add up to the original amount ($30). Not so. Actually, the $27 INCLUDES the $2. In other words, of the $30 the three men originally had, $25 went to the motel and $2 went to the bellboy -- that's the $27; the remaining $3 went back to the men.\n\nImagine the same problem with different numbers. Let's say the clerk discovers he overcharged the men by $27. He gives the $27 to the bellboy; the bellboy gives each man $1, and keeps $24. Obviously, the amount the men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($24) don't add up to anything significant (and certainly not even close to $30).

Honey he isn't full-filling your needs emotionally or physically..............Try to talk to him about your relationship and if he still doesn't care....

If your taking the pill or any other contraception which aims at controlling your hormones, this too can affect your cycle.

Unfortunately many of them do believe just that. In the past they have as a group been extremely legalistic and devoid of anything about the spiritual side of worship.\n\nToday many members of the Church of Christ are trying hard to run from their legalistic past but it is never far below the surface although they are not as strident as they once were. But in general yes they do think they are the only ones

A good place to take children of 5 skiing in austria is Soll.It has plenty of nursery slopes but also the red runs are not too bad once they get a bit of confidence up.If she has had lessons already i don't think she would need another ski school in Soll because she probably just needs practice now.Good resort not too many on the slopes at one time,and not too rowdy at night either.Enjoy yourselves..Me and my family did two years ago there my daughters were 10 & 6.
Typically, just lots of hot air, and even getting that means little. Sometimes they are economic sanctions, but as we have seen with Iraq under Saddam, those are toothless and prone to corruption (even by UN officials themselves).
Days are counted as complete turns relative to the sun, so you are always facing the sun at noon. If you did the turns relative to the room you're in, you're modeling sidereal days. A sidereal day is one turn of the earth relative to the stars, 23 hours, 56 minutes, four seconds. If you go you at midnight six months apart, you will see that relative to the stars, you are facing in opposite directions.

The release of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The book became very popular amongst the public of both countries, and while the ruling parties and merchants wanted to protect their interests in the south, they cared more for keeping things safe at home. Plus the growth of cotton in Egypt made England less reliant on the south.

The question is about unfunded mandates, something beloved by members of Congress, and especially, Republican ones.\n\nIts a law that says the states have to dig money out of their own budget to pay for something the Congress wants -- with the clincher being, if they refuse they lose ALL other Federal funding. \n\nIt's one of the great evils in US Constitional law, along with gerrymandering.

No. We Americans just like our comforts and conveniences. We're free to choose at anytime to do without the alleged benefits of having petroleum available to us.\n\nBeing a hostage is not a choice...it's being forced do something against one's will. Nobody is forcing anybody to buy their oil; we do so voluntarily. The human race went on perfectly fine for millions of years before petroleum became popular.\n\nSenator McCain might be correct if he is convinced that he speaks for those who don't realize that every person has free will.\n\nPersonally, I love the benefits of having petroleum available. I will choose to buy it for my comfort and convenience until such a time that I can't afford it anymore. It's no different than any other economic commodity.

The following links will take you to downloads of various CD/DVD burning programs, and they're all free. (I'm sure that if you want to take your time and look, you'll find more programs that you could use too.)\n\nOnce you've downloaded whichever program you fancy using, you may need to extract it from a .zip file. (If you're not sure how to do that, send me an email, and I'll talk you through it.) You then double-click on the .exe file to install the program. Some programs will want you to reboot your computer to finalise the installation.\n\nWhen your computer is up and running again, click on Start (bottom left of your desktop) and move your cursor (pointer) over to where it says All Programs. To the right, you will see the name of the program that you've just installed. Click on it. That will start the programme running. You may be asked what type of CD/DVD you wish to burn. Select data DVD.\n\nPlace a blank DVD into your DVD writer (burner), and then you'll need to show the program where the .jpg files are situated on your hard drive. (If you need help with that, let me know which program you've downloaded, and I'll do the same. I can then talk you through what to click on, etc.)\n\nThe easy bit comes next. You click on Burn or Write, whichever the program tells you to do, and sit back. When it's finished writing (burning) the DVD it may automatically eject the draw of your DVD drive. That's it! Before you delete the files from your hard drive, however, it always pays to check that your DVD can be read by your computer, or that of anyone else you propose to share your pictures with.\n\nBest of luck, sir.
At this time, it might be too late. You can start a petition drive to change the rules that have been adopted by your state Medical Board.

cute good luck keep me posted
Before WW II \n\n1854 - Japan, formerly a closed country (foreigners not allowed in) is "opened" when Admiral Matthew Peary sails his fleet into Tokyo Bay. Japan remians sovereign, under rule of the Shogun. The Emperor is largely symbolic.\n\n1854 - 1900 - Japan invites Germany to train the army, Britain to train the navy, and the shogunate disappears as the Meiji Restoration occurs (Emperor Meiji, who brought Japan into the modern industrial age). Japan industrializes, zaibatsu, or business combines ruled by important families, expand, and Japan becomes relatively modern industrially. \n\nGlobally, Japan is looked down upon as an "asiatic" nation of "yellow skinned slant-eyes" who could never equal a western nation.\n\n1850 - 1900 - Golden age of colonization - Britain, France, and Germany carve up Africa, and other independent territories. Japan has no colonies, just a few Pacific Islands.\n\n1905 - Russia and Japan go to war over Japanese desire to expand its influence in Asia, particularly Korea and northern China as well as the Sakhalin Islands.\n\nJapan kicks Russia's butt, sinking her far easter fleet and gaining new territory, including the Sakhalin Islands.\n\n1910 - Japan conquers Korea.\n\n1920's and 30's - Japan continues to expand into China, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo in northern China. The US, which supports China, is concerned, and cuts off supplies of strategic materials to the Japanese. Japan is viewed with suspicion by western nations.\n\n1936 - "Rape of Nanking" Japanese forces capture the city of Nanking and pillage and rape. Thousands of civilians are raped and killed during a short period. Japan's international reputation falls even more.\n\nlate 1930's and 1940 - America moves to cut Japanese purchase of strategic material totally. No oil or steel goes to Japan from the US. Japan is outraged. Japanese planners beging to plan removing the US as a force in the pacific and expanding Japanese military operations to secure supplies of raw materials (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere).\n\n1941 - Japan, ruled by the Emperor Hirohito, but run by Prime Minister Tojo, an army general, bombs Pearl Harbour and begins military action in the Pacific.\n\nAugust, 1945 - Japan surrenders after being defeated on land and sea, and being hit by two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nSeptember, 1945 - General Douglas MacArthur takes over control of Japan. Emperoro Hirohito stays in. This allows the Japanese people to save face and gains the Americans support by all parts of society in Japan. \n\n1945 - 1950's - Japan recovers from the effects of the war. Like the Marshall Plan in Europe, the US helps Japan to rebuild, and works with the Japanese to bring in a democratic constitution and a democratic form of government.\n\n1950 - Korean War begins. Japan is an important staging point for American forces.\n\n1950's - 1970's - Japanese products are sold world wide. Japanese goods are known as shoddy and cheap. Made in Japan is not a sign of quality.\n\n1970's - 1990's - Japan's economy continues to grow, while the US suffers through the economic malaise of the OPEC embargo, Vietnam and Watergate. Japanese quality improves. Toyota, Datsun, Sony, and other Japanese firms become quality global brands through the late 1970's and throughout the 1980's.\n\nJapan is now considered as an American ally and works closely with the US in economic matters, as well as giving civilian support to military endeavours, such as Iraq. Japan's constitution forbids the country from having a standing army or navy, although it does permit a "Defense Force" to defend the homeland.\n\nJapan is now a key player in the global world, both politically and economically. What a difference from being voluntarily totally cut off up to 1854!

Remeber that whatever you put into your body, you also put into your baby. Percocet is a combination drug - acetaminophen and oxycodone. They are both in the pregnancy risk category B. I'll give the complete list for future use: \n\nCategory A: No evidence of risk to the fetus\nCategory B: Low risk in first trimester, no evidence of risk in later trimesters.\nCategory C: Evidence of possible risk, give if benefits outweigh the risks.\nCategory D: Positive evidence of risk but the benefits should outweigh the risk.\nCategory X: Contraindicated with pregnancy. The risks outweigh the benefits.\n\nAlways make sure your doctor, and in your case, your OB/Gyn, are aware of all medications, vitamins and herbal supplements that you are using. You have most likely done no harm to the embryo but speak to your OB right away about the advisability of continuing this medication.
Lobbying for money ought to be outlawed in all countries, but unfortunately, we are stuck with it, even in the U.S.
I actually work in infection control at a hospital. Right now the nation stand point is not a matter of "if" the disease comes to the US but "when". Hospitals are being told to develop a plan for a pandemic with vaccines and anti-virals. Then they are supposed to rewrite the plan with the reality that they probably won't get either, or definately won't have enough to go around. The virus currently can not be transmitted from human to human but influenza is the most adaptive virus out there. That is why people catch it over and over. Eventually the virus will mutate into a form that can be transmitted from human to human, at that point we will have a pandemic. This current strain is being compared to the virus of 1918 that killed millions, it has the same rapid development and ability to kill perfectly healthy people. Most viruses kill those that are already sick, old or young. The best recommendations at the current time are to get a flu vaccine. It won't completely prevent the bird flu but it will lessen the effects. And proper hygiene, especially handwashing, you just don't realize the things you touch in a day and how easy transmission is. I hope that helps.

I believe our country is so divided that it will once again be another close race. Republicans are disenfranchised with the Bush administration and Democrats are trying to cater to the conservative voter because of it's powerful force. The smarter of the two political candidates should tout themselves as a moderate rather than a conservative or liberal. Politically, I believe a moderate will win the White House in 2008. Realistically, I belive a Democrat will win the White House in 2008, UNFORTUNATELY.

The neocons within the Republican party have put Alito and Roberts into the Supreme Court. They are strict constructionists, people who believe in the strict interpretation of the original Constitution without amendments. They believe that the President has powers beyond what he is embued with, because of the words "Unless the president thinks otherwise" in the original constitution. Neocon far far right wingers believe that if Steven dies or retires from the high court, Bush will appoint and have ratified another strict constructionist, thereby giving the neacons a virtual dictatorship with no legal way to have checks and balances within the government. it is already happening. \n\nThe Republicans are banking on the supremest court rubber stamping all unconstitutional acts committed by the Bush and future administrations, and also plan to dismantle all the amendments including the Bill of Rights. They also plan to declare by majority congressional vote the USA a Christian nation, and then systematically, remove other at will who are not Cristians.\n\nItg is all spelled out the Project for Americans for a New Centruy, a think tank from the far right conceived of by Dick Chaney, and whose members include papa Bush, Rumsfeld, etc...\n\nThey do not think they are committing political suicide. The omeny and world domination they hope to grasp for good is worth their efforts, so they see to feel.

A Paris-based female disco trio, La Belle Epoque scored a few club hits during the late '70s. Their first and biggest was 1977's "Miss Broadway," a Top 30 hit on the R&B charts, and they also had some success with the extended "Disco Sound" medley, which incorporated a version of Los Bravos' '60s pop hit "Black Is Black."

Go on line to every newspaper, where he's been and might be.\nWrite either an editorial letter about wanting to find him, or place an ad online, directed to him or even to directed to someone who knows him. If your padre or someone who knows him sees the ad or letter, you should get a reply of some kind. Or you can go to 411.com or even the post office. You will have to pay a fee and fill out papers. But with 411.com you just have to buy a report, if the site finds him or someone of his name.
The idea is that you might put a tag on a document that totally doesn't contain the word you associate with the link. For instance, a page about building Muppets might contain a pic of David Bowie because of that Labyrinth movie. The page might not contain any reference to him, and the picture might not be named after him, but when I "tag" that page with his name, you'll be able to find that rare pic of him.\n\nI would guess that any one person's tags are pretty well meaningless, but when you aggregate them all together, meaning emerges.

Is this some kind of dumb code?
The intent of this amendment was clear, but in today's world there may be need for an adjustment. The problem of abuse is a big issue, and with thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants streaming into this country for the sole purpose of giving birth on US soil, something needs to be done. This is a different era than in 1776, when Muslim terror was not even dreamed of and Mexico was virtually non-existent. But today, with the Mexican government clearly backing illegal immigration to the United States, and with the President of Mexico meddling in US politics, changes need to be made. Children of illegal immigrants should be exempted from the protection afforded by this amandment. Children should bear the same citizenship of their parents, so the child of an illegal Mexican immigrant born in the US would legally be a Mexican citizen. International criminals (including Muslim terrorists) should not be afforded the Constitutional protections of American citizens, but instead should fall under the jurisdiction of a military tribunal. This is after all, OUR country, not theirs.

Efficiency of photovoltaic energy depends on many factors:\n\n- Wavelength of Light: When light strikes the surface of a solar cell, some photons are reflected and do not enter the cell. Other photons pass through the material, some are absorbed but only have enough energy to generate heat and don't create charge carriers\n\n- Recombination: Charge carriers—which are electrons and holes—in a solar cell may inadvertently recombine before they make it into the electrical circuit and contribute to the cell's current.\n\n- Natural Resistance: The natural resistance to electron flow in a cell decreases cell efficiency.\n\n- Temperature: Solar cells work best at low temperatures, but solar cells work with sun light wich increases its temperature.\n\n- Reflection: When light arrives to any surface, a percentage of light will be reflected. A cell's efficiency can be increased by minimizing the amount of light reflected away from the cell's surface.\n\n- Electrical Resistance: Larger electrical contacts can minimize electrical resistance, but covering a cell with large, opaque metallic contacts would block too much incident light.\n\n- Quantum Efficiency: is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons.\n\nbecause of that silicon solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 30% or higher with multiple-junction research lab cells (gallium arsenide or indium selenide).\nSolar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available mc-Si solar cells are around 12%.

You're still young and you haven't had your period for that long. Sometimes it takes a couple of years for your body to adjust itself. Keep track of when you get your periods on a calendar or a pocket planner. Mark how long you go for, then after you're done count 28 days from your last day and mark that day. When you get close, pay attention and see how close you are to that. Hopefully this will help guess when your next cycle will be. And always keep some pads or tampons in your purse and backpack and locker so you have some available when you need them. Don't worry about it too much. Every chick goes through the same thing at some point or another. Enjoy your womanhood! :)

Homosexuality is not taught. People that are gay are born that way. People don't "turn" gay.\n\nYes, they should be allowed provided they can provide a loving and stable home.\n\nI have to add after reading this quote " I don't think any parent, gay or straight, that is a God fearing christian, would molest their child."\n\nMost people, regardless of faith would not molest anyone. If you have to be afraid of something in your faith, there is something seriously wrong. Using fear to sway a person is actually quite sick.
I do but then again I don't. I believe that if you find your soul mate you are lucky because the world is so large that the odds are against you. So I do believe there is someone for everyone, I just don't think many people find that other person.

Almost any unresolved mental trauma will reduce the brain's ability to function. Most people can remember only recent traumas, but these are often related to stuff that can be years old & lost to conscious memory, but the brain is still trying to deal with it.\n\nThink of it like your computer running a whole load of unnecessary software. It slows down performance. The difference with the brain is that anything similar to the unresolved issue goes straight into the "I can't handle it" area.\n\nUnresolved stuff still goes round in the memory & takes up capacity as the brain tries to come to terms with it. Once you're able to face meories of the trauma without it causing fear, then it is resolved & will release memory capacity & function again. \n\nCounselling clients have completely changed as a result of resolving past traumas, childhood stuff often gets stuck there. I've seen a guy who had a 40 year old incident resolved & suddenly he could do normal stuff he'd only dreamed of.
It is hard to say, because things affect everyone differently. I would go for it though. Side effects are rare, and if you dont take it you will be too ill to concentrate anyway. Good luck!

You should consult your doctor before beginning any vigorous exercise program, especially if you are very out of shape. But you can begin with light exercise such as walking. Just make sure to start with a walk for about 15 minutes, and then rest. If you can't catch your breath after a minute, then you need to slow down. Note that this is assuming you do not have any knee, hip, or back problems.

Cheese is a real character on there. He belonged to a neighborhood kid. Mac woke up with Cheese in his bed in the episode that he appeared in.

Be sure to include the fact -- which I am sure is a fact -- that their progress is largely dependent upon how quickly and how well they learn English. \n\nBlacks, of course, have grown up around English, but lately there has been a movement to emphasize rather than diminish their language differences with standard English. I believe this is a mistake. I also believe it is being fostered by people who have hidden political and even criminal agendas: the gangs seem to love to be incomprehensible to "the straights." \n\nFor the rest, learning English is usually high on their agenda anyway. Most of it has to do with not letting your pride get in the way of your learning: someone tells you how to pronounce something properly, say, "Yes, thank you," and pronounce it the way they just did. Two or three times. You are memorizing it.\n\nEducation more generally is also terribly important, but it will not go well until you learn English to the point where you are not handicapped in an all-English speaking classroom. So most people who come here from elsewhere know that they must knuckle down and study. American Blacks also seem to be getting that point. Being citizens, however, they have another option: they can enlist in the military, and let them pay for their education.\n\nGood luck with your essay. I am fascinated by the process of immigration: see my avatar? I take that kind of thing seriously as being one of the major ways we get new Americans. Notice how old our population is growing, Baby Boomers becoming senior citizens. This country needs fresh blood, fresh ideas, fresh energy. We get some in our children, and some in our immigrants.

This is a BIG question. About 50% of all AIDS patients in North America are homosexuals or bisexuals. \n\nNaturally, you can do the math to see that a gay person has much higher odds. However, this disease first moved through the gay community and later to the straight. So, the number of AIDS patients is not the same data as the number currently getting infected.\n\nTo further complicate things, these stats are drastically different from country to country.\n\n\nBottom line: \n\n1. Anal sex if physically more vulnerable to HIV contraction than vaginal.\n\n2. Permiscuity is a major factor, obviously. Gay or striaght, be careful who you sleep with.\n\n3.

if people would exercise more they would not have to worry so darn much about food...Are you really serious about doing this? We are talking about hard work. Putting down your little debbies, getting off your butt and not only going on a diet but EXERCISING!!! Even if you lose the weight it will come right back if you do not have the desire and motivation to not only look cute but to be healthy. it is going to take alot of inner strength I can assure you of that. \n\n1.) eat 4-5 small meals a day\n\n2.) drink lots of water\n\n3.)exercise every day\n\n4.) do not eat 4-6 hours before you sleep.

"A scientific law is like a slingshot. A slingshot has but one moving part--the rubber band. If you put a rock in it and draw it back, the rock will fly out at a predictable speed, depending upon the distance the band is drawn back. \n\nAn automobile has many moving parts, all working in unison to perform the chore of transporting someone from one point to another point. An automobile is a complex piece of machinery. Sometimes, improvements are made to one or more component parts. A new set of spark plugs that are composed of a better alloy that can withstand heat better, for example, might replace the existing set. But the function of the automobile as a whole remains unchanged. \n\nA theory is like the automobile. Components of it can be changed or improved upon, without changing the overall truth of the theory as a whole."\n\nFrom: http://wilstar.com/theories.htm\nThat analogy helps explain the difference, for direct definitions of scientific theories and laws see the link provided.
Emotional highs and lows are part of life for everyone. But for someone with bipolar disorder, these ups and downs can be so extreme they can interfere with daily life. Sometimes they can even be dangerous. \n\nOne day a person with bipolar disorder may feel so depressed that they can't get out of bed. Work may seem impossible. \n\nOn another day that person may feel great, full of endless energy and creativity. But other people might think that their actions are reckless and out of control. \n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong medical condition that can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Learning more about bipolar disorder can be helpful in managing this medical illness. \n\nThere are four main types of bipolar disorder: \nBipolar I Disorder \nBipolar II Disorder \nCyclothymic Disorder \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \n\n\nBipolar I Disorder - Bipolar I disorder involves one or more manic or mixed episodes, and often one or more major depressive episodes. A depressive episode may last for several weeks or months. Between episodes of bipolar I disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n\nBipolar II Disorder - Bipolar II disorder involves one or more major depressive episodes along with at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less severe. Between episodes of bipolar II disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n \nCyclothymic Disorder - Cyclothymic disorder is a long-term fluctuating mood disturbance with periods of hypomania and periods of depression. It is a milder form of bipolar disorder. That's because the periods of both depression and hypomania are shorter, less severe, and do not occur with regularity.\n \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - This type of bipolar disorder is when the person does not fit into the types of bipolar disorder mentioned above. The experiences of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. Just like the other types of bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is treatable.
No big deal. If it is not too painful, it will heal fine by itself

Myra Levine's Conservation Model focuses on conserving an individual's wholeness. Her framework includes four "Conservation Principles:" Energy, structural integrity, personal integrity, and social integrity. She describes three environments that present challenges to the individual: Perceptual, operational, and conceptual. She coined a word, "trophicognosis" to describe the nurse's judgments about the patient's condition.

Pullups/chinups. Not only does it work the biceps, but also your lats and shoulders. A lot of back exercises work the biceps too. Barbell or dumbbell rows, cable rows, lat pulldowns will all work your biceps. And squats. It may sound strange, but squats are great for a full body workout. Your body releases a ton of growth hormones just from squats alone, that all your muscles benefit.\n\nAnd don't forget to work your triceps too. They do make up 2/3 of your upper arm, and having well shaped tri's can really make your arms look great!\n\nThe link below is an article called "How Can A Bodybuilder Add Inches To The Arms In The Shortest Time?"

Medieval Italy \nAround the year 1000, we have the first documented recipe for pasta in the book "De arte Coquinaria per vermicelli e macaroni siciliani", (The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli) written by Martino Corno, chef to the powerful Patriarch of Aquileia. \n\nThe first historical sources referring to the production of dried pasta in what seems like a small-scale industrial enterprise date from 1150 when the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi reports that at Trabia, about 30 km. from Palermo, "they produce an abundance of pasta in the shape of strings ("tria" in Arabic) which are exported everywhere, in Calabria and in many Muslim and Christian countries, even by ship." \n\nIn 1279 a Genoese soldier listed in the inventory of his estate a basket of dried pasta ('una bariscella plena de macaronis'). A document from 1244 and another from 1316 testify to the production of dried pasta in Liguria, indicating that pasta was now common all over the Italian peninsula. \n\nBetween 1400 and 1500, the production by craftsmen of "fidei" (pasta in the local dialect) became quite widespread in Liguria, as demonstrated by the founding of the Corporation of Pasta-Makers in 1546 (the oldest surviving document of this guild, however, dates from 1571) in Naples. In 1574 a similar guild was founded in Genoa, three years later, the "Regolazione dell'Arte dei Maestri Fidelari" (Rules for the Pasta-Masters' Art Corporation) were drawn up in Savona. \n\nIn 1584, the author Giordano Bruno quotes a Neapolitan saying, " è cascato il maccarone dentro il formaggio " (the maccherone has fallen into the cheese).

Try to slowly (and subtly) throw hints at him that you are available. Don't run to him and tell him that you like him... maybe express your desire for a boyfriend, or a lover... tell him you've got a date with someone promising, and watch his reaction. \nTry to look your best (I don't mean modify your appearance, just make the best of it), and let out provocative comments now and then (not directed at him, just in general).\nHis reactions through this will let you know whether he has an interest in you.\nRemember: things change. Maybe he has not thought of you as a potential bride. What you need to do is getting him started at it. Once the thought appears once in his mind, it will come back. It depends on you to make it more and more frequent. \nDon't risk your friendship though... Be subtle enough to make it noticeable; but not as obvious as to make him uncomfortable if he doesn't like you.

puberty...wait for it....
When you start fooling around in a woman's anal area, you must work your way in slowly at first.. You don't just try to push up in her, it hurts too much. You must first loosen it up (using dildo or whatnot), make sure you have lots of lube and make sure that she is incredibly turned on beforehand (and while you're loosening it up, it helps to continue to stimulate her nether region).

the y-intercept is the point at which x=0.\nBut when x=0, ln(x) is undefined because as x approaches 0, ln(x) approaches -infinity. So there is no y-intercept, the appropriate answer would be 'undefined'.

It depends. Caucasion man and black girl, deffinte no.\nAmerican man and a girl of another nationality? A deffinite yes and good thing to do- depending on the nationality. But it's really better if the person you're dating is living where you're living. (city or at least country. ) That's my opinion.
Go to mapquest, there is a section that allows you to enter a person's name, age and city, and the web will find her for you.

Hi,\n\nBecause of the much photo and video editing. I highly recommend you buying the laptop with Intel's Core Duo.\n(Core Duo- is like have two cpu's instead of only one)\n-The more GB of ram the better.\n-Hard Drive I would also go with the bigger 100GB because it's stores a lot more pictures than the 80GB\n-The ATI X1600(video card- If you're a very serious gamer than go with the 256 MB version if you're not a serious gamer than go with 128mb)\n\nLet me tell you why I recommend you the Duo Core instead of the 2.0GHz\nThe Duo Core is right now Intel's newest cpu.The Duo Core was specially made for giving consumers a lot more performance for video editing,photo editing, autocad and lots more.\nNow by having a Duo Core what used to take you perhaps an hour to make(Video Editing), now will take you about 40min.or less.\nSo it really is a big improvement.
The beeps are a code from your motherboard that something is terribly wrong. Is it one long beep and three short beeps by any chance? That one means your video card has quit. Other than that you'll need to consult the motherboard manual to find out what the other beep codes mean.

Lately you find that you have a problem remembering, such things as a person’s name and the date that events are held on. You would like to improve your memory, but you don’t know where to begin to accomplish a greater memory. \n\n\nDifferent parts of the brain, handle different types of remembering tasks, such as recalling a person’s phone number versus remembering a person’s car. \n\nPeople tend to remember things differently through the use of dreferential senses, which means seeing something versuses hearing it. \n\nThis approach acknowledges, that specific memory stategies, are appropriate for different memory tasks. Memory strategies must be talented, to meet the individual’s memory needs. \n\nThis approach also recognizes that memory can be affected by many factors, including cognitive, which involves knowledge about memory strategies and some non-cognitive, which deals with such \n\nthings as overall fitness, mood and health. \n\n\nThere’s a method of memory called the Holistic view of memory. This approach is based on the concept of an individual’s memory readiness. \n\n\nScientists and health-care say that memory readiness can be improved, with a person’s attitude physical condition, their \n\nemotional state, conversational skills and the use of physical memory aids. These aids can be used in improving practical memory performance. \n\n\nTests have shown that monentary memory can vary at particular times, which can happen during the course of the day, course of the week or month. \n\n\nPeople tend to believe that their memory skills, are poorer than they really are. \n\n\nImproving your memory can be done at anytime. It doesn’t matter if your young, old, brilliant or average. Your memory can still be improved to remember better. \n\n\nThere’s no magic pill that can be taken to improve ones memory. To improve one’s memory, a person has to access the state of various memory abilities and then this adds to a person’s memory \n\nskills one at a time. \n\n\nSometimes if a person is stressed or has a cold their memory can be affected. Some nutritionists believe that vitamins help improve memory. \n\n\nThere are various memory techniques, that a person can do to improve their memory. \n\n\nOne method is the mnemonics method. This method is used for remembering information, that’s otherwise quite difficult to recall. The principle of mnemonics, is to use as many of the \n\nbest functions of the human brain, as possible to code information into the memory. The mnemonics method uses the human brain that’s used to code and interpret complex stimuli-images, colour, structure, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, emotion and languages. The brain uses these to make sophisticated interpretations, of the environment. These features are what the \n\nhuman memory is made of. \n\n\nInformation presented to the brain to be remembered,is all from one source, which is normally words on a page. Language or words \n\non a page reflects, are of the most important aspect of the human evolution. Mnemonics seeks to use all of these resources, by coding the language and the numbers in sophisticated striking \n\nimages, which flow into stronger images then are actually coded. Both information and structure of the information which is, to be recalled later. This method is simple and easy to understand. Remembering names is important, but such things as remembering, a pack of cards is just an amusing sideline. \n\n\nWhen remembering a person’s name, you can improve memory by using face association. With this technique, when you are introduced to a person examine the person’s face. Find an unusual ffeature of the person’s face. Create an association with the person’s face and the name will be in your memory. Also use repetition \n\nwhen being introduced, ask for the name to be repeated, use the name yourself, as much as possible. The more you hear the person’s name, the more the name will sink in your memory. \n\n\nW
No one knows about their relationships with their parents better than the kids, so who better to decide? I'd say go with the kids. If the parents are good friends, that's wonderful. They can accommodate extra visits, or even switch for a while, IF THE CHILD ASKS FOR THAT. It should be all about the child,not the parents. They've messed up the kids life enough as it is.
Jedi Knights have official recognition as a religion and they are on the register of religions they are also the third largest religion in UK after Christianity and Islam.\nDo you perhaps just have to say you really really believe faithfully in whatever and get a reasonable group of people who also are willing to state the same? I don't know but it might be worthwhile investigating how Jedi Knights managed it.
Hmmmmm....Kobe... or.... Shaq? That's a hard one. NOT!!!!!!\n\nKobe Bryant kicked out the second best coach in NBA history, Phil Jackson, who is behind Red Auerbach. Kobe also kicked out the guy who won him more than just one championship, the big dog, Shaq himslef. Since Shaq has left, Kobe has... lemme think... missed the playoffs and got eliminated in the first round. Since Shaq has left L.A., Shaq has helped his team to a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals and helped his team win the NBA Championship last year. Now I'm not saying Shaq is the best player on the Miami Heat roster, because everyone knows Dwayne Wade is better right now. Even Shaq knows that. BUT, Shaq is by far better than Kobe. Shaq will go down in the Hall of Fame as a better player than Kobe. No Doubt.
The earliest known reference to baseball is from Pittsfield, Mass in the 1700's, predating both Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright. The rules of baseball as it is played now date back to the early 1900's with some modifications.
The reason that children are overweight is so much more complicated than that.\n\nFirst of all, the gap between the rich and poor in this country is widening at an astromical rate. The vast majority of this country is living just above the poverty line, from paycheck to paycheck. Families need two incomes just to survive, whereas in the past only one parent needed to work.\n\nThe reason this is important is because eating healthier is MUCH more expensive than eating the cheaper processed food. A box of macaroni and cheese costs about a dollar, but buying all the ingredients to make a salad or sandwich would cost you 10-20 times that amount. Organic fruits and vegetables and healthy snack options always cost more in a grocery store and rarely go on sale. If you eat fast food, you can get an entire meal for $5, whereas if you ate at a healthy restaurant you would spend at least 3 times that if not more. The middle class is feeding their children the only way they can, which means eating Ramen noodles and frozen dinners full of unhealthy preservatives. This is a huge factor contributing to obesity.\n\nAdditionally, since both parents are working, they have even less time to cook for their children and plan healthy meals. They also aren't around enough to help motivate their children to make healthier choices. They simply have too much on their plate, no pun intended.\n\nTV is probably a very small contributor to obesity if at all. Children have been watching TV since the 50s, but you didn't see nearly as many obese children then as you do now.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck on the project.
Open up the CD Burning program on your computer. It should be either "Create CDs and DVDs", Roxio Easy CD Creator, Nero, or Sonic Record Now.\n\nYou want to create a data-disc and add the Microsoft Publisher file.\n\nTake the CD to kinkos (call first to make sure they can work with Publisher files) and I'm sure they'll do a decent job of printing the yearbooks.\n\nThe quality should be very high, especially since the file that you're burning to the CD is an exact copy of the one on your computer.

A government is the body that has the power to make and enforce laws within an organization or group. In its broadest sense, "to govern" means to administer or supervise, whether over an area of land, a set group of people, or a collection of assets. The word governement is derived the Greek Κυβερνήτης (kubernites), which means "steersman", "governor", "pilot" or "rudder".
paste special lets you choose what of the cell you want to paste.\n\nfor example, if you have a formula that's calculating averages, and you want to move the answer to a second location, if you do "regular" cut and paste, then the formula will update to the new location, giving you a screwy value. but with "paste special" you can copy just the value of the cell to the new location. this also lets you copy just the borders, formatting, comments, formulas, or any number of cool things. i've personally found it most helpful in dealing with formulas and borders, but there's probably a gazillion other applications.

That depends on the programs you are having trouble with. The only think I can think of is if the programs that don't work are really old, then they might not understand your current sound card or drivers. To solve this problem, you can use a program calld VDMS or VDMSound to run the program through (just search for it on yahoo or google). For newer programs having problems, you might want to check to see that there isn't a separate sound control in the program that is turned off. Hope this helps...

I believe that refers to Ferdinand Saussure, the linguist who developed the theory of laryngeals in common Indo-European phonetics (ancestor to most European, north Indian, Iranian languages). It was a controversial theory for a long time, proposing a sound that no longer exists in any of the modern Indo-European languages. Saussurianism, I guess, is a school of thought on Indo-European phonology.
Thinking big numbers like 1 million in 5 years is a good start. If my math is correct it is only $200,000 thousand per year. Not bad, some people even earn that amount.\nMy goal is $125,000 in 5 years. That is $25,000 per year\nat $2,000 per month. I am a small thinker. The route to my small goal is small business ownership #1. Keep your cost of living low, #2, Stay out of debt #3. Dont waste your time working for others, or sitting wasting your life away on a meaningless job. Plus be willing to work 7 days a week to make ends meet. If you are working, get a second job of personal business interest. Its hard work but happy work. Or ask a millionaire how to. Good Luck!

When Nadia was about 14 she scored the first perfect 10 at the Olympics in Women's Gymnastics. She was only 86 pounds and 4 feet 11 inches. That's about the size of a really tall 4th grader! No person, especially such a small one, had ever scored a perfect 10! \n\n Nadia Comaneci was born to Gheorge and Stefania-Alexandria Comaneci on November 12, 1961 in Onesti, a factory town in the mountains of Romania. Nadia and her family lived in a small apartment. She was an active child who enjoyed running and jumping. In fact, her love of jumping broke four of her family's couches when the springs snapped. \n\n One day, the gymnastics coach of an Onesti sports school, Bela Karoloyi, visited Nadia's school. Noticing Nadia and another girl pretending to be gymnasts, he started to go over to talk to them. Suddenly, recess ended and he lost the girls, for they rushed away quickly and disappeared into the school.
You shared a relationship with that person that is like no other. You know each other in a different way than anyone else ever will. Former lovers and future lovers will not even experience the same relationship because, I assume, most of us evolve with each intimate relationship. Plus, you have the added awkwardness of other people around you knowing you 2 as a couple so it is mildly wierd for them as well.

Factoring is another method of solving the problem. In your first example, you could write:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x + 3\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\n0 = (x+1)(x+3) <---- This is factoring the quadratic\n\nOnce you have it factored, you can solve the problem by setting either factor equal to 0, such as:\n\n0 = (x+1) which solves as x=(-1)\n0 = (x+3) which solves as x=(-3)\n\nIf you plus -1 or -3 back into the original equation for X you'll see that they are indeed correct solutions.

If there's already a # in the key signature, it doesn't matter. When the F is double sharped, you start from F natural and go up two to G natural. \n\nIn measure 34, the first F double sharp means that all F's (on that line) will be double sharped. But the third F is one octave above the first F, so it has to have a double sharp as well. Double sharps carry through the measure, but only at their pitch. So if you have a note that is the same tone but different pitch, then it has to be double-sharped again.\n\nSo if your F one octave middle C is double sharped, then all F's one octave above middle C in that measure are double sharped and don't need the sign in front of it. But if you have an F two octaves above middle C, then that has to be sharped.\n\nHey, if worst comes to worst, just listen to the CD and play by ear. If it sounds weird, then try something else...good luck!

maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\n\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\n\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\n\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\n\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\n\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\n\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\n\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\n\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\n\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\n\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD
hello Alex. First of all, calm down. If somebody is nice to you, then it does not necessarily mean that he fancied you. some friends feel that they should be good friends to others but not necessary dig deeper into intimacy. In friendship there exists a relationship of brotherhood, which, believe me, is extremely nice. It does not involve intimacy at all, but the discussions between the couple are (I would say) deeper, brighter, friendlier, direct to the point, confidential, trustworthy, well I can keep on going for ages. I do have friends in this brotherhood and I really value their friendship. \n\nNow if you feel that you have been hurt by this encounter, take your time to brush it off your nerves, so that you will not make any mistakes, approach this friend and make things clear. However do not lose on this friendship, treasure it in any other way. Friends can be valuable you know and when chasing them off you might be chucking out more than one (you never know who is around and listening). \n\nTake your time Alex, don't rush things. Don't worry I am sure you are a wonderful person and people would understand you.\n\nGood Luck

A clone is a clone basically. They're all made in a similar fashion so there's no real discernable difference from any of them. I purchased a Nike clone set from Golf Components Plus I believe was their name. It was abotu 4 years ago. Anyhoo, it's a really nice set and I have no complaints or problems with them. They're modeled after the Nike muscleback blades, the first set they ever came out with. Obviously not forged but cast but the feel and playability is still there. gives you a good "feel" for the real thing. I've known a couple of companies like Warrior Custom (Total Bulls*hit) Dynacraft and Golfsmith are very good. Don't know if you would classify them as clones makers but still make very nice clubs. The clubs I have are muscleback irons so it's kind of hard to find anyone, clone makers, that carry them. as far as your regular clubs, they also have some decent ones as well.

Having just taken a crash course in dream interpretation, I would conclude God is calling me to take arms against ignorance, especially the brand of it perpetrated in His name:\n\nThe two-headed monkey is a symbol of the confusion surrounding evolution. The green cape is both another pointer to the same confusion, but this time re to earth sciences, and a reminder that a great effort is called for – a cape is typical super-hero attire.\n\nThe golden shoes are allusions to how much has been invested in resources, time and effort in education - and yet these dunderheads grow more ignorant and blind. (Hence the 2 sets of spectacles). \n\nHe is also telling me to expose their anti-scientific approach as lies. This is why he has a crocodile’s tail, which is obviously a metaphor for “their tale is a croc.”\n\nThe white mustache is yet another attempt by Him to get me to appreciate Salvador Dali. On this I am a heretic\n\nWith this gaudy get-up, I can only assume it's a Bonobo chimp. And that would be a whole messsage unto itself.
You probably heard that D.C. has a lower rate of death due to firearms. It's a moronic comparison because of all the troops killed by IED, etc. but here you go:\n\n\nIf you consider that there have been an average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq theater of operations during the last 22 months, that gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000. \n\nThe rate in Washington D.C. is 80.6 per 100,000. That means that you are 25% more likely to be shot and killed in our Nation's Capitol, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, than you are in Iraq.

The first rule is to not let him do anything to you that you do not approve of. It's fine if you accomodate him at times, but only if you are comfortable with it. If he tries anything that makes you uncomfortable, do not let him get away with it.\n\nConcerning his "addiction", it sounds like it's fueling his interest instead of satiating it. With that said, it does sound like there is a rough road ahead. Obviously this is something that needs to come out into the open and soon. (I mean a real serious talk, maybe in a consuling session.)\n\nFinally, I'm glad that you are not perceiving this as something amoral in him, because it's not. The urges are there and that will change over time. As long as you are comfortable with what he does with those urges, things should be fine. It sounds like you're afraid that you may be uncomfortable at some point in the near future. That's what consuling and openness will have to work on.
please, please, please dont loose weight because of anything your crush said ( who, by the way, is the biggest jerk for saying anything about your weight. this person obviously is not worthy of you) lose weight when you find a reason that is completely based on your own thoughts and opinions. i wish i could take back what the jerk said because it was so wrong but i cant so just forget it and forget /her. look in the mirror and tell yourself you are beautiful as many times as it takes before you believe it. trust me, its comments like that that scar people for life and make them later develope eating disorders and low self esteem. dont be one of those people!

First, if that is an exact quote from the teacher, that teacher needs to proof read their work.\n\nThe only star that has a significant influence on our plane, and therefor our sky is the sun. The sky generally refers to the atmosphere, which consists of different types of gasses: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and many others. If the sun were to suddenly disappear it would get very cold very quick. The temperature on the surface of the Earth would fall to below -200 degrees Celsius. The gases in the atmosphere would all liquefy at this temperature, therefor what we refer to as the sky would exist no more. We would be similar to the pseudo planet Pluto. One difference is that our planet does have a molten core that would add warmth to a degree that I can not guess.\n\nTo sum up: without the sun, we would have a cold, dark planet with no atmosphere to speak of, therefor no sky.

It was the Geneva Bible. Becuase The Geneva Bible is a critical, yet almost completely forgotten part of the Protestant Reformation. Driven out of England by the persecutions of Bloody Mary, several future leaders of the "\nReformation came to Geneva to create a pure and accurate translation of the Holy Writ. Concerned about the influence that the Catholic Church had on the existing translations of the Bible from the Latin, these men turned to the original Hebrew and Greek texts to produce the Geneva Bible. This made the Geneva Bible the first complete Bible to be translated into English from the original Hebrew and Greek texts.\nThe creation of the Geneva Bible was a substantial undertaking. Its authors spent over two years, working diligently day and night by candlelight, to finish the translation and the commentaries. The entire project was funded by the exiled English congregation in Geneva, making the translation a work supported by the people and not by an authoritarian church or monarch.\nAll the marginal commentaries were finished by 1599, making the 1599 edition of the Geneva Bible the most complete study aide for Biblical scholars and students. This edition does contain the Apocrypha. The Apocrypha’s notes are minimal or absent in other editions. Additional highlights of this edition include Study Bible maps of the Exodus route and Joshua’s distribution of land, a name and Holy bible with Subject index, and Psalms sung by the English congregation in Geneva.\nThe greatest distinction of the Geneva Bible, however, is the extensive collection of marginal notes that it contains. Prominent Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, John Knox, Miles Coverdale, William Whittingham, Theodore Beza, and Anthony Gilby wrote the majority of these notes in order to explain and interpret the scriptures. The notes comprise nearly 300,000 words, or nearly one-third the length of the Bible itself, and they are justifiably considered the most complete source of Protestant religious thought available.\nIt was continually printed from 1560 to 1644 in over 200 different editions. It was the Bible of choice for many of the greatest writers, thinkers, and historical figures of the Reformation era. William Shakespeare’s plays and the writings of John Milton and John Bunyan were clearly influenced by the Geneva Bible. Oliver Cromwell issued a pamphlet containing excerpts from the Geneva Owing to the marginal notes and the superior quality of the translation, the Geneva Bible became the most widely read and influential English Bible of the 16th and 17th centuries. Bible to his troops during the English Civil War. When the Pilgrims set sail on the Mayflower they took with them exclusively the Geneva Bible.\nThe marginal notes of the Geneva Bible enraged the Catholic Church, since the notes deemed the act of confession to men – the Catholic Bishops – as unjustified by Holy Script. Man should confess to God only; man’s private life was man’s private life. The notes also infuriated King James, since they allowed disobedience to tyrannical kings. King James went so far as to make ownership of the Geneva Bible a felony. He then proceeded to make his own version of the Bible, but without the marginal notes that had so disturbed him. Consequently, during King James’s reign, and into the reign of Charles I, the Geneva Bible was gradually replaced by the King James Bible.

ANSA) - Rome, April 3 - A fourth-century papyrus manuscript containing the long-lost 'Gospel of Judas' will be presented in Washington on Thursday .\n\nThe Gospel of Judas is one of several ancient accounts of Christ's life which were rejected as suspect by the fathers of the early Church and so they did not become part of the Bible .\n\nVatican officials have denied that the publication this week is part of a rehabilitation of Judas by the Catholic Church .\n\nThe document reportedly argues that Judas Iscariot, known to Christians as the man who betrayed Jesus Christ, was an essential part of God's design and, as such, almost a hero .\n\nWithout his betrayal, Jesus would not have been crucified and so, the argument goes, God's plan to save mankind from its sins would not have been fulfilled .\n\nThe papyrus containing the text of the 'gospel' appeared about 30 years ago on the Egyptian antiquities market. It had last been heard of in AD180, when Saint Irenaeus, a bishop, condemned it as heretical .\n\nIt was recently acquired by the Swiss-based Maecenas Foundation for Ancient Art and the U.S.-based National Geographic magazine, who are behind this week's publication .\n\nThe text, which has been translated into English, French and German, is written in Coptic, the language used in Egypt when the country converted to Christianity halfway through the third century AD .\n\nThe text was the work of an ancient Gnostic sect called the Cainites, which made a habit of giving a positive value to all the negative figures in Christian scriptures .\n\nIt is believed to have been originally written in the first or second centuries. The text was later copied onto the papyrus which is to be presented in Washington .\n\nThe forthcoming publication has sparked fears among some in the Catholic Church that it could give people wrong ideas about the man who is famous for betraying Jesus Christ .\n\n"Some people will try to hide the truth and give undue importance to a document written in the 2nd century by people in open opposition to the early Christian Church," said a Rome-based theologian who is an expert on ancient texts .\n\nExperts say the manuscript is interesting and important for scholars of Church history but changes nothing in the accepted view of Judas .\n\nItaly's top Catholic writer, Vittorio Messori, noted however that the text does raise interesting questions about the role of Judas in the Christ story .\n\nInterviewed by the Turin daily La Stampa, he noted that a key difference between the Gospel of Judas and the Bible accounts concerns the question of forgiveness .\n\nMessori recalled that in the apocryphal account Judas is forgiven: "He weeps, Jesus forgives him and in order to purify him he sends Judas into the desert to do spiritual exercises." In the New Testament, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is quoted as saying: "Woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born." After the betrayal, they never meet again and, overcome with remorse, Judas commits suicide. Christ atones for the sins of humanity but never specifically forgives Judas .\n\nMessori said the lack of forgiveness in the Bible account appeared strange in a man who preached forgiveness .\n\nHe also noted that Jesus's choice of Judas as a disciple in the first place seemed to show a slip of judgment .\n\nBut, as someone who wanted to believe the Gospels were true, he said he was glad of Judas's presence. "If the gospels had been invented, the figure of Judas just wouldn't be there because he's so embarrassing," he said .

I find your options too limited. Its never been about facts, its about hope love and charity. We all have a good idea what those virtues are, but there is not a fact among them.\nDoes a parent love their child? You can't do experiments on that to decide, black or white, its true or false. As the Savage Garden song goes, "I believe parents did the best they knew how to do".\nDo you know if an elevator is safe, for a fact, before you go into it. No, if you had to prove everything before you believed it - assumed it - you would be frozen with uncertainty.\nThe best you can hope for is reasonable certainty.\nReligion is reasonable, though many religious people are totally unreasonable in they way they talk about religion.\n\nI guess you think science is all about facts, but most of it is theory, reasonable assumptions. Data have to be reasonably accurate but even with the best intentions, the next experiment could show a weakness in a theory. That why they do the experiment.\n\nSo lets open our minds with a good degree of humility and be reasonable in the way we treat each other, we are all in this together.

I have a friend whom I've known all my life, who got really hairy around your age. He also went bald by 20. People made fun of him in high school as well.\n\nLike him, you just happen to have a lot of testosterone. It makes you hairy all over except where you want it.\n\nHe works out and has a good body, but he goes shirtless in the summer and nobody comments on his abundance of hair. He shaves the fringe of his hair, so he is completely bald now. He recently remarried, and his new wife loves his body. \n\nI can see how you could be confused by your abundance of body hair, considering that you never see lead actors with chest hair anymore. I don't know why they all shave their chests. Of course, if you shaved everything off now, the conspicuous absence of your hair will raise even more questions. If you want a reason to shave your body hair, join the swim team and you will probably be required to shave your chest, legs, arms, etc. However, if you do this, you may probably have to shave your head as well. If you think you are going to go bald and want to hang on to your hair for as long as possible, this may be a problem for you.\n\nJust accept the fact that you are probably more well advanced in your manhood than the rest of the other guys. Hey, look on the bright side: having all that testosterone means you have really strong "swimmers" as well, if you know what I mean!

The person sending the invitation would like you to tell him or her whether you accept or decline the invitation. That is, will you be coming to the event or not? Etiquette rules followed in most Western cultures require that if you receive a formal, written invitation, you should reply promptly, perhaps that same day. For hosts who are planning a dinner party, a wedding or a reception, this is important from a practical point of view, because they need to know how many people to count on and how much food and drink to buy. More important, though, is the simple courtesy of responding to someone who was nice enough to invite you, even if it is to say that you regret that you will not be able to attend

Cane toads are the largest species of toad in the world, and adults can reach 4 or 5 inches in body length (one record holding specimen is close to a foot in length). They are grey, brown, reddish or greenish in colour, with mottled patches of brown, black or dark reddish brown. Behind their eyes they have very large parotid glands, which are the glands that produce bufotoxin. Cane toads produce very virulent toxins, and can actually squirt it as much as a meter away. This toxin can kill quite a large number of predators, and is potent enough to injure or even kill humans.\n\nCane toads are not the only species of toad that produces bufotoxins however. There are a large number of toad species that secrete all manner of toxic substances. Some of them might not be potent enough to affect your dog, but some of them can be. In general, you shouldn't let your dog come into contact with any kind of toad if you can help it.
it could be but didnt the hospital elaborate a bit more about the diagnosis,anyway i hope he gets better soon im sure he will.

The day of the Lord. It is sad but if you asked a preacher what the day of the Lord was he would probably argue Saturday or Sunday. It is neither. When John was taken to the third heaven he was taken to the Lords day. Not Sat or Sunday. The sabbath is your day. The wrath of God is the LORDS DAY. Love ya God Bless There are about 80 scriptures about the Lord day, have a look and see.\n\n10But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. \n\n 5Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: 6And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\n\n10For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.\n\n12For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
The foods made of vegetables, fruits and grains/lentils are essentially what vegetarians eat. Some will also consume milk and dairy products and eggs. For eating this does no harm to animals.\n\nThe trick is to be able to find the right nutritional balance if you are going to maintain good health and growth. The foods should also be prepared in such a way that it is tasty and something that you would like to eat.\n\nAny good vegetarian cook book will have plenty of ideas on menus and recipes.\n\nMany Indians are vegetarians and enjoy a perfectly good health all their life.
Its called a manometer. A U shaped device half full of water with on end connected to, for example, an air duct and the other end open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the duct will force the water in the manometer up the atmospheric side so many inches. The pressure is then measured in inches of water.

The Bank will deduct tax from the interest payable to you. \n\nThat amount so deducted will be paid by the bank to Government. and will issue TDS certificate to you, which can be used by you against your payable tax amount at the time of filing I T Return.
Don't be talking to your ex hubby. You may not think he can get to you that you are happy, but they have a way of getting to you. I know because I have been there and I am now remarried to my ex because I let him back in, I regret it deeply. So my advice the less you talk just as friends the better off. He didn't change until you were happy and with some one else am I right.

Your egg is only viable for about 24 hours after ovulation, but sperm can live for about 3 days in your vagina. The problem with "ovulation dates" is that you can't depend on them. Your body reacts to stress and other factors which can cause you to ovulate early or late. The best way to tell you are "ripe and ready" is by your cervical discharge. When it looks like egg whites (thick, clear or whitish, and stretchy) you are ready for insemination. You can check your cervical discharge with a finger inserted near your cervix or (for the squeamish) by checking your tissue after you wipe.

Very much depends on how much money you have to invest and how long you want to invest it. Today as interest rates are going up, I would be cautious about real estate. If you buy a house for yourself, go with a fixed rate mortgage. Mutual Funds might provide a better answer as they have historical offered a higher rate of return. Look for a company that has performed well year after year. (American Funds, Vanguard)

I hate to say it, but how people look at interacial relationships will differ greatly from place to place. I personaly have no problem, and think that interacial relationships help broaden the perspectives of both individuals. There will always be people against it, and it's hardest when one of your family members is truly against it. All I can say is that if you love the other person it can be great, but stay light hearted with other people and understand that there are a**holes and there are open minded people.

You tell her that your willing to take that risk in order to get to know her better and become closer to her.
Don't settle for just anybody that you meet walking down the street. Generally men and women are on different wave lengths. Lots of women are generally melodramatic and some are gold diggers. Your best bet is to get to know some one for a long period of time but don't attach yourself to just one person, but always be open and honest. One day you will meet that special one and you will be happy. Good luck!!
Definitely go for the accredited school. It makes a big difference.

The answer requires you to make an assumption about the relative probability of an apprentice compared to a non-apprentice getting injured. If the chances are equal and independent, then the answer is simply 1/binomial(3,16) = 3!x13!/16!= 1/(7x5x16)\n\nIf the probability of an apprentice being in the wrong place at the wrong time is higher than a non-apprentice, then one can assume that the probability is somewhere between 1/560 and 1.
In HS, A linebacker often makes the defensive "play" calls for the team. He will call which back to key on (Fullback or halfback), what coverage the secondary will play (man to man or various types of zone.... and will make calls for the Defensive line to shift left or right or to change fronts. \n\nThe calls that he is responsible for become more sophisiticated as he progresses through a system, and College LBs often have more responsibility than HS, and a Varsity HS linebacker has more responsibility than JV.\n\nAs for responsibilities on the field, some of the other answerers have been spot on. A LB generally is responsible for making tackles, and possibly covering the TE or RB out of the backfield on passing plays. They are also occassionally called on to Blitz...

Most polls are targeted towards people to get the answer they want. Furthermore, the actual questions are skewed towards the answers they want. When you hear, "A poll shows that U.S. troops think they should leave Iraq." The question may very well be, "When do you feel you should leave Iraq? a) 1 year b) 5 years c) never.\n\n90% of the media are democrats. \n\nIt only takes 1000 people to make a "legitimate poll".
You guys have a difficult task at hand. Cheating for three years... that's a big deal.\nBut, if you guys have decided to work it out, then do just that. Stop reading the emails, cards, etc. It happened and you can't take it back. If you're devoted to making the marriage work, you'll both have to put the past behind you, learn from it and work to make sure it doesn't happen again.\nThis will probably take some counseling. That's a difficult situation for a couple, especially with children.\nGood luck!

Sort of. European culture is quite a bit different than Asian culture, so they aren't even remotely similar, BUT...\n\nEuropan fencing, boxing, and wrestling are all forms of Martial Arts. Martial = fighting and Art = something stylized and learned.\n\nAnd in Scottland, the Scottish Highland Dancing was originally developed for the Scottish wariors to improve balance and coordination.\n\nAnd I've seen a few books from Europe on sword fighting written for the slightly richer than average citezen. It was pretty stylized, and they remind me a lot of the books I've read on Kung Fu in modern days.

Whistler has the highest vertical (5200 feet), and I believe Kicking horse is the highest at +8000 feet. Sunshine, which sits on the border between BC and AB, is at 9000 feet. Both of these are FAR more than vermont or montreal areas (I think an big hill in the east would have less than 1000 vertical feet-not including tremblant).

Haiku poems are usually about nature, which is why the assignment was given. Poetry.com has a haiku section where you can make a poem from the words given and submit it to win a prize. It's pretty easy.\n\nNo, the poem doesn't always rhyme, but it says something powerful. Notice in your oem that it is a "bitter morning" and the sparrows are sitting "together" and "without any necks." Can you feel how the birds are so cold that they sit close and bury their heads in their feathers to keep warm?\n\nI'll give you an idea ... and you can think about what to write. The other day I was driving into a city from my tiny country community. I saw a hawk perched on a fence post. At first I thought it was a statue, until he turned his head. He appeared stately in his fashion, uncaring about the world passing by. He turned his head to look at me and seemed very bored. I thought about stopping to take a picture, but was afraid he would just fly away. So I went on my way and left him to do what stately hawks do in the afternoon.\n\nYou might think of that image and try to write something on it if you wish.\n\nGood Luck!\nSue

Sure, if you can afford it. Isn't it kind of sad that it's cheaper to eat junkfood than stuff that's good for you? Organic food is absolutely, 100% better for you...but you'll spend A LOT.\n\nAnd by the way, screw you for giving me a thumbs down. You know what you can do with that thumb? I'll give you two guesses, and the first one don't count.\n\nAnd dude, where do you get your facts about there not being evidence to show organic food is better for you?

Hello,\n\nCongratulations on deciding on a long-term decision right at the outset of your getting together.\n\nBy deciding to buy your home, you will do the following:\n\n1. Stop paying someone else's mortgage.\n2. Build your own equity.\n3. Since both of you put together have a high income, you will book the tax benefits.\n4. Fix your monthly payment on living in a home for your lifetime (based on your mortgage).\n\nThe Process:\n1. Check your credit by yourself. Try to work on any cleanup that you might need to do (like some irregularities in payments or any other incorrect reporting regarding your credit history. A good Mortgage agent should be a great help and be able to do everything for you. But some mortgage agents might use this for a rip-off.\n2. See if you can identify your objectives, needs and wants. Like, if you want to live close to downtown, a new home, a nice neighborhood, commute, lifestyle etc.\n3. Find a good Realtor who will help you understand your objectives, needs and wants and put them in perspective so that he will help you identify the home you will want to live in.\n4. A good Realtor should be able to take care of the entire process. You have to zone into your dream home out of the Millions of properties available out there. You will also have to identify your constraints in terms of finances, having a Realtor will give you all these ideas.\n5. It is very important that you pin your requirements, it will make the process of selection very easy.\n6. The process itself.\na. Find a Realtor.\nb. Find a Mortgage Agent.\nc. Find a house.\nd. Once selected, make an offer.\ne. If the offer is accepted\nOrder inspections, title reports, HOA docs if it is a PUD / Townhome.\nFinalize Mortgage.\nRemove Contingencies based on investigations.\nGet ready for sign-off.\nSign-off\nDo a walkthrough inspection\nFund your mortgage\nGet your Keys\n\nYou may want to browse on the internet for some more preliminary understanding.\n\nDisclosure: I am a Licensed Realtor with Century 21 in San Jose, CA.

By the time I was old enough to make up my own mind about what I believed, I realized I couldn't imagine a world without God in it.\n\nAs an adult, I have felt the presence of the Holy Spirit in me, have heard what I believed to be God speaking to me, and have seen what I believed to be God's will at work in circumstances that could not be logically explained. That is why I believe in God.
How old are you?\n\nMarriage is about giving yourself to someone emotionally, mentally and physically. If you can seriously and honestly say that you would sacrifice everything for your significant other, make sacrifices even if it grossly inconvenienced you, then you might be mature enough to begin discussing marriage.\n\nIt is a bigger deal than anyone who has never experienced it can imagine.
Most common answer is stress. Stress of work, money, family, health, past traumas.\nSometimes lack of sleep also causes nightmares.\n\nSleep-aid causes nightmares for me. They explained it as it's a creative outlet for my brain since my body was forced into sleep by the pills.\n\nIt could be a subconscious anything being twisted and distorted.
The quality of the answers to this question so far, except one is really disturbing. First of all, the U.S. is not in a war with Iraq. The Iraqi Government is working with the United States to put down an insurgency which challenges the legitimate elected authority of the Iraqi Government.\n\nAlso, Russia does not pose a great threat to the US from a conventional point of view, although they still have nuclear weapons. Relations between the US and Russia are not bad at all, although there are bumps from time to time. YOu should be more worried about the Iranian or North Korean situation at this point. Between those two, North Korea has a much more impressive, although logistically hollow military. Iran is not considered to be an offensive threat, but could and would defend itself fairly well against invasion.

Pena there is one GLARING flaw in your argument. There is nothing about Mexico to be proud about. Mexico is a country, not a heritage. People from Mexico are of Spanish(for the most part) Heritage, just like I am of English and Irish heritage. Yet you don't see me waving those flags around, why? You can say it is because I am not proud, or whatever, but the simple fact is I am an American, and proud to be one. I am proud of my roots, but me being an American comes first and foremost.
I assume you mean expansion valve.\n\nFailure of those valves is very rare since they are not really operated in a typical home AC. However, the valve could get plugged if something were to come loose or break off in the system, and I guess after time the valve could get worn. \n\nThis may happen even quicker if there is a mixture of liquid and gas passing though the valve. That combination usually cause turbulence, and may damage the valve. This may happen if the condenser is not cooling well enough and the coolant is not being fully liquifide.

Hi. The Yahoo!Answers team here. We think that the basic concept of people asking and answering questions for free in an online forum is as old as the Internet. We know there are a lot of sites that are similar to this service. But we think what will really differentiate us is whether we are more or less successful in hosting a service that will get you the answers to your questions. And we will strive to do the best we can!

Oh my, she can't look for it herself? Well, to get her started....Boys & Girls Club, hospital (they have volunteer greeters, volunteers who help visitors find their way around, etc., your local library probably has volunteer positions, your local humane society ALWAYS needs volunteers (that's a big one at our house, my daughter has volunteered with them since last summer), almost any youth organization such as Girl Scouts (Call your local Council office, they'll be listed in the phone book), check with your church, try the local Optimist clubs, betcha if you either look in your local Sunday paper or call the newspaper office they'll be able to give you some organizations to try as well.

OMG this is so true! \nThe girl is totally clueless. I think she walks around with her head up her ar5e. If you disagree with her she says, "crybaby pc liberals" or "liberal pusses" (yeah spelt that way). But you ask her a valid question and she won't answer it. I don't know how she can say she likes politics when she's so ignorant. I said it before and I'll say it again. Before you start to bad mouth others you should look in your own back garden. She's against immigration but without it she wouldn't be here. Hello Americans are immigrants (except the Native Americans). \nDoes that make sense? \nShe doesn't like asylum seekers but she supports Jews in America. Hello they were seeking asylum from Nazi Germany! This woman is seriously mixed up. \n\nBut get this- in one of her answers she states she wouldn't b1tch slap a pc do-gooder because of the liberal in her.\n\nHey Jane L why do you call everyone who disagrees with you a PC liberal? Are those the only words you know?\n\nEverything is black and white to her. She can't see that people can have views that are liberal and views that are conservative. What an idiot. The whole idea of a debate is that you talk, listen and answer but she just talks. She won't answer or listen.\n\nYou know what I learned? She's not worth the effort just ignore this poor creature. You can't debate with a child.

HOW did they steal money? If you lost money, and this went across state lines you can involve the FBI. How do you know they "hacked" your buddies computer? Most likely he had a virus which was a keystroke logger, meaning anything typed was sent to the virus writer. If you logged in then they got your password. Best thign to do is try to log in to your account, when it fails do password recovery since you know the answers, unless they changed them. Then contact yahoo through their help system.

I would choose Pujols due to his all around great playing and his history of being injury free. You can count on him pretty much every day. A-rod is an all around type of player as well but he does not get as much rbi's due to the star line up they have and you can never tell when he may go down again. He has been injury free for a while but you never know. And right now Pujols has been really injury free.
At first I thought so, but now I wonder. Anyone who agrees to do a lie detector test would have to be innocent in my opinion. I know a lot of lawyers tell you never take one, because they are so inconclusive and some people get so nervous, every question is screwed up and can make you look guilty. \n\nWhen the camera is on him sometimes he looks guilty. I just don't know. I feel so sorry for the child. It is also my gut feeling he is innocent.
I'm in agrement. I'm a non-smoker, and I think that if the restaraunt wants to, they should inform everyone that it's a smoking establishment, and let it be. \n\nThere are other alternatives as well, for instance, a permit system that allows establishments to have a smoking bar/restaurant. The local authorities could manage the number of places that allow smoking, and if demand increases, they could release more permits. \n\nThese places should still allow a seperate section for non-smokers, completely seperate, or not. It would just depend on the market. \n\nBut either way, I'm all for as little governemen interference as possible, allowing the market to set the demands.
If your spouse is open to 'letting you play' with others of the same sex.. then I guess that would be a personal decision. I would make sure if you are female that he doesn't have the hidden agenda of 'hoping for a 3some'.. since that is 'man's #1 fantasy'. If he does and you do too, then it's fine for whatever you two decide as long as it's honest and open.\n\nAs for telling someone else.. I would ask them.. if they have ever had a bi experience. Their answer would pretty much tell me, if it was 'safe' to tell them. For example if they went No, I haven't had one of those, but I have a lot of friends who have. Or No, that's wrong.. (I don't agree but it's an example of when I wouldn't share that) Or Yeah, Bi is cool, I have done it and with the right person it's great! Any positive answer would open the door for you to say that you are. :) I wish you the best with that :)

On myspace there is a search button where you can type in names of your friends or there is a section at the bottom on your home page that lets you find friends through you address books either in AOL, Yahoo or Gmail. After it is done importing your addresses, it will tell you who of your friends already have myspace profiles,and it will ask you if you want to add these people to your friends.\nTo get the cool layouts, and what not, there are tons of webpages that are associated with myspace.com...one of the most popular and the most helpful is mypimpspace.com.
If you have expensive medicines, you need to seriously consider enrolling in Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nDespite all the complexity, you need to get on a Part D plan.\n\nIt is a true shame that lawmakers when passing first the Discount Drug Cards and now the Part D plans could not have simply made it easier for seniors and the disabled to understand.\n\nUnfortunately there is no one central, trusted and unobjective resource for making this easier.\n\nThe on-line tools you are using may be your best bet.
I would definitely not recommend it since Adderall is a stimulant and can cause a panic attack in a panic-prone person. There are better meds to combine with Zoloft if you have panic problems along with attention problems. I personally feel that Adderall is too powerful a stimulant to be used in a panic-prone person but I am not a pharmacist (only a psychology graduate student who took psychopharmacology and loved it). Please ask your doctor or better a pharmacist before taking that combination. I doubt it would be fatal but it could cause a panic attack and would not likely be helpful in any way.

I USED to do the stuff. Im a recovering addict. I can tell you that the more pure stuff has a brownish color to it. But it can by white also. My guess would be that it probably is. Sorry to say.

Also if you are really worried that it could be get a drug test kit.

History was made in New York on October 6th, 1927 when the very first spoken voice in a feature film was heard.\n\nThe voice belonged to Al Jolson and the ground breaking movie – The Jazz Singer. The reaction by the theatre audience was immediate – they rose to their feet, applauding ecstatically. The moment came in the middle of the film when, during a nightclub scene, Jolson suddenly spoke.\n\n\n The first words ever spoken in a movie were, “Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain’t heard nothin’ yet!” The words were truly prophetic in light of the massive advances taken in the realms of movie sound since that time.

Walks and hits per inning pitch. This is more or less the number of baserunners a pitcher allows an inning... this is also considered a more accurate representation of how good a pitcher is (much more so than ERA).\n\nA excellent WHIP is 1.00 or under; usually only the top closers and maybe one or two starters have WHIPs this low. A WHIP of 1.50 I'd think would be average, anything above that is... not very good.
I think you should pray very hard for God to send you more christian friends without using the net. There are all kinds of nuts out there. I know how you feel, though.

There isn't really an answer to this question. The town is never mentioned in the movie, only in the books it is mentioned that she lives near Butterfield. However, Butterfield does not exist. In some publicity material Baum had for his 1904-05 comic page, Dorothy writes a letter to her old friends and the address given is "Uncle Henry's Farm Near Topeka." In the book Return to Oz, Dorthy lives outside Franklin, which does exist. There is a tourist attraction in Liberal, Kansas that called Dorothy's house, which is a relocated farmhouse built in 1907, along with the original model of the house used in the film and a collection of memorabilia. Hope this helps, although there is no real answer
My sophomore year of high school, that year's valedictorian gave a graduation speech I will never forget. \n\nAt my high school, we had an "intruder alarm". If there was an intruder in the school, a secretary would go over the intercom and announce "Mr. principle, would you please take the Red stapler to the whatever hallway?" Well, he got up on stage and the very first thing he did was hold up a red stapler and say "Mr. Principal, I've found your red stapler."\n\nHe then went on to impersonated just about every teacher in the school, which is quite a feat, considering our school had nearly 60 teachers, if not more...\n\nFinally he tied it all in saying that his time at the school had been a time where he had grown, made friends, and was prepared to move on in his life. \n\nIt really was one of the best valedictorian speeches I'd ever heard.

I am not sure what question you are really asking...\nThe American English morphed from British English, just ask in any language there a handful of dialects many times seperated by geographic regions and social class. (Chicago has 6 accents). So that is how Europeans can tell the difference, because your accent is not British. \n\nYou DO have an accent- even as one poster said, it could be the "non-regional"/media accent. People with a good ear for languages and dialects (usually people who are multilingual) can detect accents easier than others who are monolingual. \n\nIt also could be that you developed more of your accent of your native region since you left. For some reason, I have noticed this phenomenon with a lot of Americans after living abroad for some years. For example, I grew up in the midwest, but nobody ever believed me because they said I didn't sound like it- but the longer I have lived away from the midwest I have noticed that I sound REALLY midwestern without hearing it at all!\n\nAlso, Europeans can spot Americans a mile away... it's the way we carry ourselves-- we smile a lot more and speak louder in public and often all they have to do is look at your clothes or your feet to know.

Unfortunately, there are far more men in positions of power than there are women... and that includes those in charge of what we see on television and in films. So, in short... they pick and choose what "sells". I love men. I love seeing men... I get absolutely nothing from seeing some chick's boobs flash across my tv screen. In fact, I don't even watch tv anymore because of it LOL. \n\nBut to answer your question, my personal belief is that we don't see more naked men because too many men are deathly afraid of seeing another guy's penis :) I mean, why is it that full female nudity is perfectly acceptable, yet it is extremely rare to even see a man's azz on a screen LOL. Hmmm... this was a wonderful question. I could go on for days about tihs! :)

Did you sign an occupancy affidavit at the closing?\n\nDo not use a "free" rental agreement or one of those standard forms from Staples or whatever. I could tell you hundreds of horror stories from people who used those agreements and screwed themself royally. Same thing with deciding to be a landlord when you know absolutely nothing about it.\n\nDo yourself a great big favor. Make an appointment with the top landlord/tenant lawyer in your area. Make sure that is their specialty. Pay them to do a lease that is specific for your area and your needs. Have them give you a crash course on local landlord/tenant law and how it applies to you and your proposed situation. The $100 to $200 it costs you now could save you thousands and thousands in the end.\n\nA true horror story from my office:\n\nWoman rents out her condo when she is transferred. She buys a "legal" lease from one of those landlord sites and uses it. A year later, she decides to sell the condo and make some serious money while the market is hot. This way she can buy a new place where she now lives, pay cash and have a huge chunk of change left over.\n\nShe gives the tenants 30 days notice a month before their lease is up. The tenants say they aren't going anywhere. So, she comes to our office to evict them. We tell her "Sorry, but your tenant doesn't ever have to leave if they don't want to as long as they pay their rent because 1) in this county, if you rent a condo to someone, it must state in big bold letters at the top that it is a condo and subject to sale or else you are required to give them a 2 YEAR notice if you are ending their tenancy if you want to sell the place, 2) leases in this state automatically renew themselves on a month to month basis and you don't have a right to evict simply because a lease is ending under the anti-eviction act of this state and 3) this $9.99 bargain of a lease does not contain the all-important "right of re-entry" clause needed in order to evict for cause in this state, so the fact that you didn't tell them in the lease that it is a condo doesn't even really matter at this point. They don't ever have to leave even if they did give you cause to evict."\n\nShe's hysterical because prices more than doubled in the past year. Her 150K condo is under contract for 320K, and now she can't sell it because of this. She wants to sue the online landlord site because they told her the lease is "perfectly legal". We have to tell her she doesn't have a case because ... the lease is perfectly legal, it's just not in her best interests. \n\nDon't be a schmuck over $100 to $200. Pay a professional for their expertise and advice.

She had all the qualities that he may have needed. Hoopz was a good one but as i thought she wasent ready, NY was too in love to have just been meeting him at the start of the show and i thought she may have been more of a headache in the long run. She was very self centered just as Hottie was.

Kitty is just opening the Longbranch, when Festus comes in,all smiles, and spurs a'jagglin'. "OH BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIRIE, THE OLD CHISHOLM TRAIL will be just fine with me♫" \nKitty: "Festus, you have a beautiful voice,you know that?"\nFestus: "Why thank you, Miss Kitty. Old Matthew doesn't think so, I'll tell ya that.He jes kicked me out of his office ..'pears I was breakin' up his thinking."\nJust then, himself, walks in....\nMatt: "Hello Kitty. 'lo Festus. Sorry about my grumpiness....I had to write a letter to the REVEREND MR.BLACK. I finally finished. How about a beer, as my way of apologizing?"\nFestus:" Oh, fiddle, Matthew, you don't need to do that."\nMatt: "Well, if you don't want one," he says, smiling.\nFestus: "Well, now, I didn't say that, ...I , well,...\nMeanwhile, Doc has joined the group.\nDoc:" For heaven's sake, hush up and take the drink." He rubs his face, as he always does when talking with anyone that has a lower IQ than a tumbling tumbleweed.\nFestus: "You old, scudder! I'm a fixin' to....smart aleck."\nThey all sit down at the table for a little early afternoon chat.\nDoc: " Matt. Did you soak that arm last night, like I suggested?"\nMatt: "No, Doc...I DID IT MY WAY. I got a good night's sleep. It's fine,now."\nKitty: "Surprise, surprise! He did it HIS way!"\nDoc and Festus could see that there was a storm a brewin'.\nDoc: "Festus. Finish up that beer and come take a walk with me."\nFestus: "Take a WALK with you?! Why would I wanna do that?"\nDoc: "Because I said so. We'll see you two later." \nFestus leaves with Doc, grumbling the whole time.\nFestus: "Why in the tarnation are we going to take a walk?" Just then a pack of dogs come ambling over."GET ALONG LITTLE DOGGIES."\nDoc: "OH, hush up, would ya! Matt and Kitty needed some time alone...that's why!" He rubs his face again.\nFestus: "Doc, why is it you're always a rubbin' that face of yers?"\nDoc looks at him, rubs his face again,shakes his head and walks away.\nFestus: "He's gettin' a scarier and a scarier all the time." Meanwhile, back with Matt and Kitty...\nMatt: " Kitty...you mad at me or something?"\nKitty: "Matt, THERE'S A CHURCH IN THE VALLEY, over by Hayes City. YOu meet me there Saturday, 11am, or ELSE!"\nMatt: "Why do you want to meet there?What are you talking about??"\nKitty: " Listen...we've been doing whatEVER it is we've been doing, LONG enough! Either we get married, or you get your free beer at another bar!!"\nMatt's knee involuntarily pops up and almost knocks the table over.\nMatt: "Get married?! Now hold on, here, Kitty. We've discussed this time and time again. You know that...\nKitty: " We have not disCUSSED it!! You keep talking about your damn job and before I can get a word in edge wise, you're out the door,riding off to get shot somewhere...living me here, left to worry to death!!"\nMatt sees one of those dogs that was outside. It has come over to his side.\nMatt: " OH! SHENANDOAH, how you doin', boy?"\nKitty: "That's it, I'm out of here!"\nAs she starts to leave, Matt gets up and grabs her arm.\nKitty: "Let go! I'm through talking!"\nMatt: "Me,too." He picks her up in his arms and carries her upstairs to her room. In a few minutes the walls begin to shake as Matt lets out a high pitched, "Yippee Ky AAAAAAAAAA."
First you must understand the notation that is being used to represent the chord. The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary.

Two answer this question better, there are two answers i.e, two solutions.\nOne, Off the field, when the players are done playing and practicing, they should have good enough income to supprot their families, so that they can focus on the game. This can be achieved by sponsorships and ads and fundraisers.\n\nSecond, practice practice and practice. They need to practice team work. There should be team building activities. There should be trained and have fitness sessions everyday. They should be passing and dribbling practices. They should have an obsticle football course. They should have target practices varing the target sized etc. \n\nThis should really be helpful...

A US liquid gallon = 231 cubic inches = 3,785.411 784 cubic centimeters or 3.785 litres.\n\nAn Imperial gallon is approximately 277.4193 cubic inches and exactly “4.54609 cubic decimeters” (i.e., litres).\n\nThe imperial gallon is therefore 20% bigger than a US one so it is important to specify which one. Better still, don't use either and stick to international units.\n\nLitres or even liters have been legal in the US since 1875. Can we please flush gallons down the pan.

Well, at least you are consistent...consistently wrong on all three statements. \n\nIn point of fact, it is not to the military's advantage to bring in the three types you are talking about...why would the government spend all that money on training them, and then have to release them at some point? In the case of "fat", I'm talking way fat. the military does give a prospective "chubby" recruit the opportunity to lose weight before the day he/she reports, but they must weigh in before going through basic.

If you really like the guy, and feel you a had a connection worth taking further, then you need to go there and talk to him in person - these types of conversations are never well suited to phone-calls or emails.\n\nKeep in mind that a three-way deal such as this can be tricky at times, and Brian probably feels caught in the middle - possibly even feels a little guilty for getting so close to his best mates ex. Just don't feel like it is something wrong with you - these are never easy situations. \n\nThe only thing you can do is talk to him face to face - if your friendship is worth anything to him, he'll open up and talk top you about how he is feeling. If he doesn't then simply chalk it up to experience and move forward.\n\nJust don't let this stop you from being true to yourself or allow it to close over your heart - then you really have lost something precious.\n\n*EDIT* - scandalous my butt! That's just worrying about what other people think - the one thing which usually does more harm than good. Be true to YOURSELF not to what other people think you should be like

I don't get offended. If you want to fly the flag of another country, this is the land of the free, go for it. I probably will get a bunch of thumbs down for this opinion, but if you think about it, flying a flag of another country is not showing disrespect for America. It is showing pride in where they came from, but not disrespect of America. I was born and bred here in the US. I can trace back my lines to my american Indian heritage, and also to my English heritage. However, my husband is from Honduras. I, not him, but me, bought a Honduras flag, and it is hanging in our children's room. I also bought one of those flags that go onto the windshield of our car - and it was a Honduras flag. But that doesn't mean that I am showing any disrespect for America.
first and foremost as your president I would put a cap on how long you can receive welfare. and when you get a job you have to pay back what you "Borrowed". second, I would do away with "three strikes and your out". if you committ murder, rape, molestation, etc you automatically get life. Third, everyone who reaches the age of 65 and eligible to retire will automaticall receive "FREE" health insurance. Our eldery have done their part and they should not have to pay for their medicines and wonder how they will eat. Fourth, Any person entering illegally will not have the luxury of applying for a temp. work visa, temp. social security number. someone said once, "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" and thats exactly what you will get. Why we hand out these benefits knowing they are illegal is just defeating the purpose. By continuing this we are taking two steps forward and one step back. Get here the right and legal way or don't come at all. We understand the hardships you go through in your native country, but..quite frankly, we are not your native country and we have laws for a reasson. and we all know priests do not become pedaphiles, pedaphiles become priests so they can engage in their sick behavior, you will no longer be just "fired" and sent away to therapy. You will be going to jail, I hear they have really good "therapists" that share your cell. Prison sentence of "LIFE" in most states means 25 years, but LIFE will now be until you draw your last breathe. We will no longer interfere with other countries and how they handle their business, if they choose to run themselves down or quite frankly, blow themselves up well...what ever floats their boat. I like so many others am tired of the B U L L S H I T, so help me, help you stop pickin' up other people's CRAP!

Don't place all conservatives as ignorant. But I agree with you that abstinence only is wrong. I think it is the prudish society that doesn't even want to tell their 5 yr old what their body parts are. People should be taught responsibility for their actions. If you engage in sex, this is what can happen. Teach them the consequences for the action, not "don't do it".

I work for an Early Childhood Intervention program which commonly works with premature babies. The good news is I have seen babies born as early as 24 weeks survive. Statistics say that ethnicity does play into this. Black females have the highest survival rate and White males the lowest. Some common problems I have seen in preemies are:\nbreathing problems, make sure he gets RSV shot Oct. -Mar.\nEye problems - most extreme preemies have Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), this cause various eye and vision problems, surgery can help or it can resolve itself but most likely he will need glasses. \nTone problems - muscles tend to be very tight or sometime very soft, this usually causes motor delays\nReflux, just about every preemie is on Reglan and or Zantac. \nFeeding issues, it is also very common for preemies to be tube fed because they do not have the strength to get a good suck going or they have GI problems\nInfection risks are higher for preemies and some strong antibiotics can cause hearing loss. \nStudies do indicate that preemies are at higher risk for learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Disorder, Get Occupational Therapy as early as possible to help regulate his sensioneural motor skills!!!\nThe good news is that there is great Medical care out there and every state has an infant and babies program which help support and educate families and provide a variety of intervention services (therapies ) to babies. If your baby is early make sure you look for your state's program as soon as he is out of the hospital.

Mat is usually conducted 4 times in a year in February, May, September and December. The minimum qualification for appearing in MAT is graduation in any discipline from any recognized University or equivalent recognized degree. A final year student in any undergraduate (i.e. B.A, B.Sc., B.Com., B.Tech., etc) can also appear provisionally. Usually, there is a minimum percentage requirement in graduation, which is different for different MIs/University. For this refer to the prospectus of the particular MIs/University.\n\nNext MAT date is 03, December 2006 (Sunday) in the afternoon session. \n\nCheck out details http://www.successcds.net/2006/Management_Aptitude_Test_MAT_2006.htm

I go further back than that (UK).

You have to really think about this question. Have you ever been in a waiting room in a radiology department/facility? Have you seen all the pregnant women sitting there, waiting for their ultrasounds? Did you ever think this was a health risk for them?\n\nAny room that is used to take x-rays is shielded with lead in the walls. You could be on the other side of a wall that x-rays were directed at and have no measurable dose. You could be in a bathroom that shares a wall with a x-ray room and get no dose. The x-ray room is completely shielded so radiation cannot pass through it. Don't you think x-ray workers would all be dying of cancer, or at least all have cataracts if this wasn't the case?\n\nHave you ever had a loved one in the ICU? We also do x-rays in surgery and the emergency department. We do x-rays on portable machines on a regular basis. If you are not right in the path of the x-ray beam, and if you are not close to that path, there is no exposure. X-rays do not travel for eternity...they dissipate. \n\nThe use of x-rays and the rules that surround them are above and beyond what is necessary to protect the public. These things are tested on an annual basis. If we don't pass, we don't do x-rays anymore. \n\nSo, you should feel safe living next to an imaging center.

You are missing the fact that Joely Richardson had family difficulties during taping so they had to come up with away to send her off with what was going on in the story at the time. So a storm comes into Florida and destroys much of the area. Shawn is dreaming most of what is going on in the episode because he has just told Julia that he cheated on her. He has just told her that he had a cleff palate as a boy. He has just operated on Connor's hand and is ready to move on to hand number two. He has alot on his mind. Connor, Marlo, Christian, Matt, Julia, Anne and his father. He is afraid that many of their choices will backfire.\nOne thing to notice is they wrote in nothing about Kimber or the baby. What they wrote about is Anne having issues with her Princess party, Matt following in his fathers' footsteps, Connor thinking like Shawn that he ruined his parents' marriage, and Julia still having a relationship with Marlo even after they broke up in the last episode. In short this one long nightmare in the midst of the storm. When the storm is over, however, they are talking about having to rebuild things and that takes times. They are talking allegoically about their relationship and about the city damage. Julia flies off to New York with the children and Shawn stays behind to clean things up in Miami. Colin Redgrave, Joely's uncle was near death with cancer and her daughter had a serious leg injury. That meant she needed time off to take care of thing.
Absolutely. And my wife and I used to go garbage picking in various neighborhoods the night before garage pickup. We've gotten all kinds of good, resaleable things. Such as a wine cart, book shelves, expensive electric typewriters, more things than I can even think of right now. It got so bad, we've had to quit, because we don't have room for everything. A good place we found to dumpster dive was behind a local Kmart. We've gotten a power saw, drills, flowers, plants, books, bags of dog food, cat food, lots of unopened potato chips bags, gum, health food bars, etc.. that had just recently expired. \nThe funniest time (looking back) was when I was in a dumpster and it started raining, I had trouble getting out, then it started to lightening, and it was amazing how I managed to fly out of that metal dumpster. My wife, who was watching, thought it was hilarious.

OK little'un. From a parent who "trusts" a kid online.\n\nThe ONLY way a caring parent will trust you online with blogs or IM .. or myspace is if they have the tools to easilly monitor what you are doing online.\n\nIt is NOT just a matter of trust, it is a matter of SAFETY to a parent who cares. I know that a parent who cares is a real PAIN .. but you should be thankful, many kids don't have a parent who cares one iota.\n\nThere are many tools out there, some are low cost or free, the better ones cost a some bucks. One of these tools, once they are loaded on your computer, keep track of EVERYTHING you do on your computer. Your parent can come in at their leisure (even online from work in some cases) to check what emails you have sent or received, view complete conversations that you have held online, view EVERY web site you visit. Some of these tools even allow the parent to set time limits on your internet access. (yes, Johnny, the web is addicting, IM is addicting and you can waste your entire life before you know it on the WWW)\n\nI know this is not the most exciting thing for a youngster to contemplate, having a parent know EVERYTHING you are doing online.... but .. for a parent who cares .. it may well be the ONLY way they will allow you to get online and experience the whole universe of the web ... safely.\n\nAs long as you are careful, only enguage in proper conversations, NEVER give ANY personal information over the internet that could identify you. Your parent will be happy with your web access .. including IM.\n\nI had used a product called I AM BIG BROTHER several years ago .. I know there are much better products out there now. A web search should quickly turn up a dozen or so parental monitoring tools that your parent might accept.\n\nGood luck.

a hiccough (or hic-cup) occurs when:\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.
Each country that has won the World Cup has a star for each time they've won.
I don't know about "neighboring nations"..what I do know is that we built a wall in CA and it was deadly.

Mozilla is a computer term that has had many different uses, though all of them have been related to Netscape Communications Corporation and its related application software. The various uses of Mozilla (all of which can be referred to by using just the term "Mozilla") are listed below in the order when they were first used:\n\n\nCodename of Netscape Navigator\nMain article: Netscape Navigator \nMozilla is a trademark of the Mozilla Foundation and historically had been used internally as a codename for the Netscape Navigator web browser from its beginning. It was a contraction of Mosaic killer, referring to the hope that the project would unseat Mosaic as the web's most popular browser, and a reference to the name of the fictional monster Godzilla.

Every body of mass produces a force of gravity. The larger the body, the more gravity it produces. The sun is large enough to produce enough gravity to pull Earth towards it. However, at the same time, Earth is in motion. The motion would be straight, but because the sun's gravity pulls Earth towards the sun, the Earth's path of motion is curved around the sun. It is like swinging a ball on the end of a string, with gravity acting like an invisible string.

No, they are not stupid. They are victims of ignorant white people, whom automatically associate hip hop style and music with inner city black crime.

Like the young lady said, each to their own. Attitudes like yours keep tensions too high between races; you need to free your mind.

I think that the factual evidence in the core samples drilled from around the world say that the earth does have warm and cool cycles. I also believe that it is possible that whatever is inhabiting the earth during these cycles will invariably affect them in some way, be it natural or non-natural emissions and/or by-products.\nI think that if it is "bad" or not is all relative to how you look at it. Will the weather be worse or more extreme? Possibly. Is the earth trying to correct any imbalances? Possibly. Is this good or bad? I guess it is how it will affect each individual.

The Alchemy that I believe in is not the Alchemy that most people talk about. Not transformation of one metal to another so much as intensification of hidden qualities. Participation in a repeated derivation and recombination of the essential oils and the essential saltes of an herb intensifies the medicinal effect of the herb AND refines the participant's personal vibrations to a 'higher' tuning.\n\nI believe in Magick too, and that's a much more immediate source of transformation.

I think it's every weekend for a month and generally held at a Hilton resort.\n\nActually, I believe it's only 8 weeks.
Yes. \n\nIf you know you have pending taxes, the best way is to contact the IRS and make the arrangements to file. You must file first. It is required. That way you will know better where you stand and you are beginning to be in compliance. Then you can talk about how to pay the amounts indicated by your returns.\n\nThe payback scheme is based upon the income you need to live. This may mean such things as changing the kids to public school, one telephone in the house, eating in, etc. In the old days this was called "tightening your belt". By the way, the IRS has charts that give working numbers for living expenses according to family size and other criteria. You must document your necessary expenses. \n\nIf you let the default go, interest will accrue and worst things begin to happen, such as a lien being filed against you(which then becomes a public record), your employer could be contacted and your paycheck could be affected.\n\nDon't give excuses unless they are legal. “I was irresponsible and I want to rectify my mistake”, is probably more palatable. Work with the tax man and he will work with you.\n\nNo, I don't work for the IRS.
Statistically, more men are hit by lighting, (only a percentage of whom die as a result, by the way), because men are more likely to hold jobs that are outdoor based, and are more likely to engage in outdoor activities. Simply a sampling error based on who is available for the lightning to strike.
The Appraisal Subcommittee has a website where you can download a list of all licensed appraisers in NJ (or the US). At the site, go to the tab at the top of the page that reads "National Registry." Then, click on Custom Reports. In Custom Reports, simply select NJ as the license state and Active (so you get a list of active) appraisers. The list can be downloaded into a couple of formats, including Microsoft Excel. Once in Excel, if you are familiar with and have both Excel and Word, you can print a form letter addressed to each licensed appraiser you want to work for.\n\nGood luck. This is the hardest part of the licensing process, finding a supervisor. When I teach pre-licensing appraisal courses, I tell the students to start looking right away.
All six landings, including the first, took place on the near side. The prime reason was so that the astronauts could stay in radio communication with Earth, and radio waves don't travel well through 2160 miles of rock. All lunar seas are on the near side, except for the Sea of Moscow. One landing, at Taurus-Littrow, did not take place in a sea. Taurus is a mountain chain, Littrow a neighboring crater, but they are on the near side.
HA HA HA this question is very similar to "why do people breathe?" well they fraud for money...thats it...the only thing behind ffrauds is money. They want money easier than others do. So thats the inspiration behind fraud!!!
No I totally disagree. Money is not the most important thing in life. Love and living! If you are on a deserted island would you rather have somebody you love or a pile of cash. Money can be made to pay the bills but without love what good is a ton of money. I'm sure people disagree but I would much rather have love in my life then a lot of money.
For the disk i can help you. You need to go into the BIOS and change the mode of your SATA disk to Legacy from the current setting.

well, you've got the frist thing right: you want to. that's a huge step in the right direction. get a notebook for each class, and take notes on what the teacher says. review the days lessons each night before you go to bed. keep track of when homework is due and when tests are so you can be prepared.\nsecondly, you need to realize that you're not perfect, and I hope your parents realize this, too. you're not going to get 100% on every single thing you hand in. there will be subjects that are hard for you. accept it and do your best, there's nothing wrong with not being perfect.\nthirdly, understand that many other students aren't going to feel the same as you. they'll want to play and waste time while you're studying. they will probably try to get you to follow them, and they may be mean and make fun of you for your hard work and good grades. this hurts, but ignore them, they're the ones who are going to end up in dead-end jobs while you've got a good job.

There are more taxes placed on business than indivuals. And what you see is the effect of taxing the businesses which trickles down to the consumer, which is us. So when a business gets more taxes they have to make money to pay it. So, that ends up to be part of the extra money we have to pay to the companies. Someone has to pay it..
The definition that the other two gave is correct, a mutation that has no effect on reproductive fitness, also, on a more concrete level, a neutral mutation also refers to a mutation that causes a change in one amino acid in a polypeptide chain that doesn't have an effect on the function of the protein. Often this occurs when one amino acid is replaced by a chemically similar one, which could be caused by a single base pair mutation.

A test is valid when it measures what it is supposed to. It is reliable it yields consistent results. You find out more at:\nhttp://www.georgetown.edu/departments/psychology/researchmethods/researchanddesign/validityandreliability.htm\n\nThe disadvantages of using secondary data:\nYou do not have the control over how the instrument is designed, how they are collected, or how carefully they are manipulated and documented. Another serious trade-off between primary and secondary data is the issue of anomalies; when you are using data you have collected yourself, you have a clear understanding of how those data should appear (in a frequency table, for example). You are more quickly able to spot and correct those anomalies. If you are using someone else's data, you won't necessarily know all of the subtleties that were involved in making coding decisions and in inputting the data.\nhttp://ed.isu.edu/research/Procedures/DataType.htm

Yes, it's extremely irritating. Regardless of the comments of those who say "enter public spaces at your own risk", in the name of civility and social order we owe each other some adherence to social norms. How would your detractors feel if someone decided to take a leak next to them at the bus stop? Hey-- if you're that uncomfortable around people, then maybe you shouldn't be taking public transit-- right? Where do we draw the line? Disregard for social space and reasonable social norms brings us to the level of pigs in a pen. Many people, as we know, are pigs.
Some exameples are: skateboarding, inline skating, snowboarding, or one of the more extremer sports, such as Moto X, skysurfing and kytesurfing.\n\nExtreme sport (practically synonymous with the term action sport) is a general term for sports featuring speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a so-called ‘‘adrenaline rush’’ in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of dopamine endorphins and serotonin).\n\nExtreme sports are often associated with young adults wishing to push themselves to the limits of their physical ability and fear, in turn pushing the boundaries of a particular sport. This youthful demographic accounts too for extreme sports’ frequent association with youth culture, not restricted to clothing fashions and music.\n\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one is as much to do with marketing as it is to do with perceptions about levels of danger involved or the amount of adrenaline generated. Snowboarding thus has a more extreme ‘‘image’’ than skiing due to differing marketing strategies and the fact of being a newer sport, even though skiing is a faster and at least equally dangerous activity.

Sir Walter Raleigh's famous "Lost Colony" was founded on Roanoke Island, near present-day Manteo, in 1587. When the colony's governor, John White, returned to the colony in 1590 after being gone for three years, he found the settlement deserted. The only clue to what had happened to the colonists was found carved on the trunk of a tree near the settlement, the word: "Croatan." No trace of the colonists was ever found by subsequent explorers and settlers.1\n\nThe Stuarts succeeded Queen Elizabeth as monarchs of Britain. Charles I was beheaded in 1649 and Oliver Cromwell ruled during the "interregnum." Charles II returned the Stuarts to the throne in 1660 and rewarded his loyal supporters. Eight of these loyalists (Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon; George Monck, Duke of Albemarle; William Craven, Earl of Craven; John Lord Berkeley; Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Berkeley, Governor of Virginia; and Sir John Colleton) were rewarded by King Charles II by being made Proprietors of his new colony, Carolina, which reached from the southern boundary of Virginia, incorporating the Southern Plantation, to the northern boundary of the Spanish colony of Florida. The western boundary of Carolina was to be the "South Seas."2
Well, it depends on where your fishing(from a boat or from land).\n\nArtificial lures: For snook, your best artificial lures are jigs & "curly-tailed jig bodies" (1/4 to 1/2 OZ) in chartreuse, root-beer, or white/natural color's. Also, try any "soft-plastic stick bait" in the aforementioned colors,("Senko's", "Wave Tiki baits", "Charlies"). Rig them "Texas-style" .\n\n MAKE SURE you buy some "Menhaden" spray attractant to "sweeten up" ANY lures or jigs.\n\nOf course, "saltwater" Rapala's and "Yo-zuri" Crystal Minnows will work too, but they tend to get "hung up" in the mangroves. Whatever artificial you throw should be as "weedless" as possible. \n\nBaits: The same 1/4 to 1/2 OZ, (use a chartreuse jig-head), jig-head rigged with a large "mud-minnow" or shrimp would probably be your "go to" bait of choice. Rig the shrimp "hook through tail" and the minnow "through the lips". Also, a GREAT bait are "Pogey's". Cast-net some pogey's and use them as chum and under a "popping cork rig". The cork combo works great around jetty's and open-water situation's. Rig the pogey "in the back", and the shrimp "right behind the eyes". \n\nYou can fish on the bottom with cut-bait or dead shrimp but your odds on catching anything good (this is a "trash-fish" rig) are slim. Unless, of course, you plan on going "off-shore" ,whereas ,cut-bait, and a "bottom-rig" will work great on Grouper. Go to Floridasportsman.com for further info.\n\nIf your fishing from a dock a "float rig" with "live shrimp" or "pogey" will work ,(and everything else I've mentioned too).\n\n If your at a ocean pier, use a pyrimid sinker #2-3, a "sinker-slide", a Fluorocarbon leader 12 lb, and a "circle hook" size 1/0-2/0. If you are at a pier you would be fishing for "Whiting", "Reds", "Sea-trout",Sheepheads ETC. Have one rod rigged with a "pyrimid-rig" and another with some type of artificial: jig, spanish-jig,ETC. \n\nSome of your BEST fishing will come in the early morning and late afternoon.

The Army has replaced the m16a2 with the m4, but the Marine Corps did not; they have adopted the M16A4 as their service rifle. It is yet another version of the standard M16, but with attachment rails on the hand guards (and other minor changes). The Corps only uses the M4 in limited applications.

Never have to worry about "finding the hole" because you have yourself a beacon of light shining upon you russians girlf friend...So, I say to you....Congratulations.
ok! well i used to have the same problem, MAJORLY! I read heaps about this. One thing i never knew is that eye liner actually contributes to this, because it carries chemicals that go into the pores to give this effect- so try not to wear it often and ALWAYS wash your face really well.\n\nNow theres this stuff... i totally cant remember what its called! Well like its something like moisture boost or something? and its meant for putting under your eyes! it works really well! \n\nbecause the skin under your eyes is half the thickness of the rest of the skin on your face, so it is prone to dryness and bags.\n\nDo a search and read up about it. All skin types are diffferent, and different methods will have different effects.
That observation hasn't been lost on me either. It does seem a lot of people's priority here is to be judgemental first and helpful second, but you get what you get when you ask a question. You can't control people's fingers from typing what they want to type. Just ignore the answers that bother you and focus on the good ones from the nice folks out here :)

My personal preference is houses rather than units, because:\n- land appreciates, which you get with houses, not units\n- you have more financial control with a house, as strata fees can be imposed on you when you have a unit\n- you have more development/improvement opportunities for a house than a unit.

Dascartes rule of signs says that the number of positive roots of a polynomial (with real coefficients and ordered in descending powers) is equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive coefficients or is less than that by an exact multiple of 2 (since double roots are counted twice) Negative roots are counted by changingthe signs of the coefficients of all odd powers of the variable and counting the sign changes the same as for positive roots.\n\nIn your first problem there are 3 sign changes so there are 3 positive roots (one of which may be a repeated root). Changing the signs of the x^3 and x terms leads to no sign changes (all of the coefficients are negative) so there are no negative roots and the total is 3 roots, all positive.\n\nIn the 2'nd example, there are 6 sign changes so there are 6 positive roots. Changing the sign of the x^5, x^3, and x terms leaves no sign changes so there are no negative roots. Since a polynomial of order n has n roots, there are 8-6 = 2 imaginary or complex roots in the polynomial and 6 real roots (which may contain repeated roots)\n\n\nDoug

I think that Cleveland is dramatically improving every year. Sure, theyre not there yet, and theyre probably not even making the playoffs this coming season, but they are a team to watch for the future. Theyve got a young, skilled QB, an experienced RB, and a pretty decent coach. They have some holes defensively, but with the work they did this free agency season, and if they come out well in the draft, they could be a team to watch the next few years. I predict that they will win the superbowl with 15 years from now.
My fiance and I were in the same situation. We did some research and from what we read, it's easier to bring in your fiance into the country, then get married, and then apply for permanent residence. It's easier that way. If you get married first, there's lots of red tape because it's harder to prove to the government that you got married for all the right reasons and arent just trying to help someone immigrate. It takes longer that way. So, my fiance and I applied for the fiance visa in February, it got approved this month, and he should be here by August. So, it basically takes about 6 months, but with bringing a spouse over, it can sometimes take longer. Good luck.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres

I don't know if any of the below will help you, but here goes nothing:\n\n"&#92;item{&#92;itemc.} Gravitation acceleration near the surface of the Earth.\n The force of gravity near the surface of the Earth on any small\n object of mass $m$ is\n $$ F= {GM_{&#92;oplus}m&#92;over R_{&#92;oplus}^{2}} &#92;,&#92;, , &#92;eqno(&#92;eqn)$$\n where $M_{&#92;oplus}$ is the Earth's mass and \n $R_{&#92;oplus}$ is the Earth's radius.\n The acceleration effect of this force on the small object can be\n learnt from substituting from $F=ma$:\n $$ ma={GM_{&#92;oplus}m&#92;over R_{&#92;oplus}^{2}} &#92;eqno(&#92;eqn)$$\n or\n $$ a={GM_{&#92;oplus}&#92;over R_{&#92;oplus}^{2}}&#92;approx 9.8&#92;,{m&#92;,s^{-2}}\n &#92;,&#92;, . &#92;eqno(&#92;eqn)$$\n Thus, the acceleration of a body due to gravity alone near the\n Earth's surface is independent of the body's mass.\n Because of its great utility this acceleration is given a special\n name $g$.\n And in rocketry, one often measures accelerations in units of\n $g$.\n Equation~(&#92;showeqn -0) is result that is famously evidenced by \n Galileo's\n dropping of different mass balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa\n circa 1590.\n The dropped balls start from rest and have the same acceleration\n all the way and reach the ground virtually simultaneously \n It seems to be a myth that these demonstrations are myth (Fa57).\n They were probably demonstrations for students rather than formal\n experiments.\n In Aristotelian physics, more massive objects reached the ground\n first, but there was no quantitative mathematical rule describing\n their motion."

The twelve ghosts which make up the Black Zodiac all have their own unique back story, and while these were not described in the film, the production and make-up teams used them as guidelines. All the ghosts were contained in glass prisons, and were caught with the aid of the psychic Rafkin, who could locate them, and on the behalf of Cyrus.\n\n1. The First Born Son (played by Mikhael Speidel)\n\nThe First Born Son is the ghost of a little boy called Billy Michaels, who was obsessed with cowboy films. Not heeding his parents' advice, he played Cowboys and Indians with a real bow and arrow, and the arrow went straight through his forehead.\n\n2. The Torso (played by Daniel Wesley)\n\nThe Torso is the ghost of a gambler called Jimmy Gambino. Losing everything in a poker game, he tried to welch on his bet and escape. The mob, which he owed money to, caught up with Gambino and cut him into several pieces, wrapping them in cellophane and dumping the corpse.\n\n3. The Bound Woman (played by Laura Mennel)\n\nThe Bound Woman was a cheerleader, who was strangled after a high school prom after cheating on her boyfriend. She was strangled by him, and was later found buried on the football field.\n\n4. The Withered Lover (played by Kathryn Anderson)\n\nThe Withered Lover is Jean Kriticos, the wife of Arthur. She died in the freak house fire while trying to rescue her children.\n\n5. The Torn Prince (played by Craig Olejnik)\n\nThe Torn Prince is the ghost of Royce Clayton, who was a baseball star. He challenged a greaser to a drag race and was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\n6. The Angry Princess (played by Shawna Loyer)\n\nThe Angry Princess is Dana Newman, who constantly tried achieving perfection with her looks, despite being beautiful. She gave up eventually and slit her own wrists. She was found with dozens of self-inflicted gashes on her. The movie suggests that she killed herself for another reason (In the scene when she appears in the bathroom, you see the phrase "I'm sorry" on the floor in blood). This, however, was probably there to add more drama to the scene and not true.\n\n7. The Pilgrimess (played by Xantha Radley)\n\nThe Pilgrimess is the ghost of Isabella Smith, an English woman who travelled across the Atlantic and settled in New England. She was a separatist, and this isolated her from the other townsfolk. She was found guilty of witchcraft, and put to death in the stocks (pillory).\n\n8. & 9. The Great Child and The Dire Mother (played by C. Ernst Harth and Laurie Soper)\n\nThe Dire Mother is the ghost of Margaret Shelburne, who was imprisoned by a group of lumberjacks, forced to live in a cage as a form of entertainment, due to her being only three feet tall. She had a child with one of the lumberjacks, a son Harold who weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nHarold was spoiled by his mother, who raised him to be her protector and to exact revenge on the lumberjacks. Harold took up his father's axe, and was capable of chopping down massive redwoods single-handedly. Eventually he turned the axe on the other lumberjacks, and both he and his mother were killed by a frenzied mob.\n\n10. The Hammer (played by Herbert Duncanson)\n\nThe Hammer is the ghost of a blacksmith, George Markley, who lived in a small town in the 1890s. He was driven out of town after wrongfully being accused of stealing. Enraged, he tracked down the people responsible and hammered them to death. The other townsfolk captured him, and they drove large nails into his body and cut off his hands.\n\n11. The Jackal (played by Shane Wyler)\n\nThe Jackal is Ryan Kuhn, a psychotic mental patient with a penchant for attacking women. He was permanently in a straitjacket, and had a metal cage locked around his head. After years of this, he had grown deformed, and reviled human contact. He was the only victim of a fire that broke out in the asylum; he apparently ran into the flames rather than let anyone touch him.\n\n12. The Juggernaut (playe

It depends on if you want high risk with you owning everything, if this is the case go after bank loans.

I had a dream I saw Jesus in Jerusalem when I was a very little girl. I lived in the mid-west, but in the dream we were in Jerusalem. I thought I saw something, so I left my mother and went into an alley. The alley was really dark, and every so often there were people who were playing out Jesus's life. When I got to the end, he was there. He held out his hand, and I woke up.\nI only had this dream once, but boy do I remember it!

You would build a green roof the same way you build a orange, or purple roof. However it is slightly different from a blue, red, or yellow roof. \n\nIt depends on the square footage of the roof, the materials that you will use, and the restrictions for the open space under the roof to name a few. If you have natural materials close to where the roof will be, then use them, like the trees, rocks, and vegetation.\n\nBut make sure that when you build it, OVER engineer it. The weight from the roof, water, wind, and animals will add a force that needs to be addressed.

Polyamy is the name generally given to the practice of taking multiple wives. A larger family probably would be harder to run, but talking about the husband/father "controling" his family is patriarchal bs.
Religion develops as a means to provide a grand explanation for *everything* (ie. weather, sources of food, death, interpersonal relationships, social systems, etc.). It gives people a sense of security and predictability. Sometimes the use of religion goes beyond predictability to the point of being used for control. \n\nWhen one questions someone else's religious beliefs sometimes that triggers an insecurity that gets expressed as hostility. If the questioning reduces control and individual has become dependent upon to maintain social or economic status the response can be extremely hostile. \n\nThis is not to dismiss "religion" as a merely useful (for some) fiction. Institutionalized atheism (China, and Stalin's Russia) has killed many people as well. I guess you could just lump religion in with any ideology that attempts to assert itself on others through political or social means.

I don't know who posted that question, but the premise is silly. From an economic standpoint, America gains from immigration (legal and illegal). \n\nThose that legally enter America do so because we are a land of opportunity. They are able to apply their skills and talents to better themselves. In the meantime, they are part of the population that find better ways of doing things (technological advances). Technological advances increase everyones standard of living. \n\nThose that come here illegally are hired by firms because of the cheapness of their labor. This lowers the costs of products that all Americans buy. If this wasn't true, then there wouldn't be an illegal immigration problem. The government would have taken care of it long ago. But, in the end, money talks so the political question on illegal immigration will not be decided in the near future. There is a lot of disagreement over this. Many people contend that illegal immigration overwhelms government programs costing the country more in services than their labor provides. For myself, I wonder how much the American consumer has saved through lower prices compared to what they pay in taxes so the government can pay for those services. Granted individual states may experience problems, but my bet is that for the nation as a whole, the American consumer is the beneficiary.\n\nAs an example, our population recently went over 300 million people; a 20 million increase from 5 years ago. This was attributed to immigration. Has our standard of living gone down? No, it has gone up. That's because these people are working. They increase our GDP. Even if they do not provide for increases in knowledge and technological breakthroughs (which everyone does through specialization), the proportional split on GDP is the same as if they did not immigrate. \n\nMy thoughts on illegal immigration are solely from an economic viewpoint. From a societal, security, etc. viewpoint, I think we must stop illegal immigration. I fully support legal immigration and believe it is a strength in America.\n\nSorry so long, but I can be a chatty bugger.

I have had and worn scaves amost of my life. Scarves were fashion until recently. This is what i found on a website noted in the sources section below.\n\n"a lost art...wearing headscarves...what today is sometimes called head wraps. Back in the 1950's, 60's, and early 70's, wearing headscarves was fashionable...even with teenage girls. So what happened? \n\nThree turns of fate...\n\nFirst, the Catholic Church stopped requiring that women cover their heads in church. Second, the carmakers stopped making convertibles (they make them again, but the damage is done). Finally (and worst of all), the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy (in Iran) in 1979. Headscarves were linked with religion again, but this time (in what Western countries perceived) in a negative way. Of course, there were changes in hairstyles and other factors, but these were the big three...particularly the last. Of course, the September 11th attack and the war with Iraq has once again provided an unfair negative focus on headscarves."\n\nIn the Western world (except for the Catholic Church) the scarf was a fashion accessory, not religious clothing.

Hehe, speeches/oral presentations aren't my kind of thing either. First thing to remember is, NOT TO BLUSH. Just imagine talking to some friends. Things to remember to get you good marks (if there are any)\n\n- Eye contact (just stare to the back of the class)\n- Loud, clear voice\n- No ums and ers.\n- No shifting from one leg to another\n- No bored voice/look\n\nI remember when I had to give oral presentations. I tried pretending the whole class were my best friends, but it lasted about 2 minutes, I found myself sweating as if I'd ran 10 miles at the end.

WELL with lots of training and experience they will. But if it werent for luis figo we wouldnt have won any of our matches. its a shame this is his last world cup. the team needs his guidance and inspirations. lets just hope that we will get really far in this world cup. as for the next world cup we will just have to stick together and get fresher shoes on the field!!! I LOVE PORTUGAL!! they are gonna beat mexico...... I hope :)
the average brain can calculate 100 million MIPS (Million computer Instructions Per Second )\n\nalso, scientists have calculated that while even the biggest computer has a capacity of around 10,000,000,000,000 bytes (10 to the power of 12), the human brain has a colossal 10 followed by 8,432 noughts, say the scientists who made the calculations in the journal Brain and Mind.\n\nso basically, you are pretty darn smart.

Well you are partly right. He became seperated for GOD for a short time so he could take the sins of all of us upon him. God can not look upon sin so Jesus was alone and human on the cross. He paid the Ultimate price.He never lost his faith because he and GOD are one person. There is a passage that when he was praying in the garden of Gesemane he said Oh that you would take this cup from me(his crucifiction) but he then prayed but it is your will not mine that be done.So I dont know if this helps you any but it shows the fulfilment of the prophsey and that he had to be human to die for our sins yet never lost his faith or beliefs.
I recently did a research paper on the explosive economic growth of China and how they're letting it ruin their environment. It's an interesting topic. Their population and life expectancy has skyrocketed too. Did you know that the average life expectancy in 1949 was only 35 years? Today it's approaching 80. You could just focus on how China's economy has doubled in 20 years, or you could relate that to their poor polution control practices.

Well, I don't understand why denying that Islam has problems and should be corrected. it drives me nuts when ppl say that those religious terrorists groups are not real muslims. then who is real and what is real? you should first cleanse Islam openly and honestly from all hatred rules toward others. say that the rules that violate laws should be thrown away, not the opposite. it is interesting ppl say that those are not real Muslims while they say Saudi is best or Iranian is best and both they endorse or do nothing to hate. clerics you hear them from time to time, saying that hate to the infidels and non-muslims is duty!!! and those who say anyone cooperate with christian and jews are traitors or infidels or whatever.

The phrase 'arrow of time' refers to any process that is assymetrical w.r.t. time. I.e. the process happens in one direction and not in the other direction (or more correctly, the reverse process is exceedingly improbable).\n\nThe main arrow of time that we are aware of is related to the physical quantity called 'entropy' and the law of the universe that governs it, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. It would take some space to describe this properly, but to summarize, 'entropy' can be thought of as the amount of disorder or randomness in a closed system (one that is not receiving heat energy from an outside source). The 2nd Law says that the entropy (disorder or randomness) of that closed system can only go up over time. I.e. things don't get 'less random' unless some outside energy is available to cause that order. The 2nd Law is perhaps the most profound law of the universe, and the only one we know of that introduces a time assymetry (an arrow of time).\n\nThe wiki page (see Sources), provides a nice list of different concepts of the arrows of time:\n- The thermodynamic arrow of time (entropy)\n- The cosmological arrow of time\n- The radiative arrow of time\n- The causal arrow of time\n- The weak arrow of time\n- The quantum arrow of time\n- The psychological/perceptual arrow of time\n\nIt sounds like you're interested in the cosmological arrow, and there are two possibilities:\n\nThe first is entropy (the thermodynamic arrow), and the idea that the entropy at the Big Bang was very low, and has slowly been increasing, and will eventually and inevitably lead to the heat death of the universe.\n\nThe second arrow is related to the expansion of the universe, and if gravity eventually causes the universe to stop expanding and begin contracting, the time arrow will be reversed. The idea that the 2nd Law itself would be reversed is pretty radical. I.e. ... that as gravity pulls everything together, things will become more and more ordered, and entropy will be *decreasing*. \n\nIt's not clear how this second arrow will affect perception by intelligent beings. It may be that we can't tell the difference ... i.e. that mental processes are bound to the thermodynamic arrow (entropy) ... so if this is reversed by the contraction of the universe, we won't know the difference and the universe will always appear (to us) to be expanding. Maybe that's what has occurred! :-)\n\nHope that helps.

In 1799, the French armies under Napoleon were camped outside of Acre. Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. The project was stillborn because Napoleon was defeated and was forced to withdraw from the Near East. The letter is remarkable because it marks the coming of age of enlightenment philosophy, making it respectable at last to integrate Jews as equal citizens in Europe and because it marked the beginning of nineteenth century projects for Jewish autonomy in Palestine under a colonial protectorate. After the defeat of Napoleon, it was largely the British who carried forward these projects, which have in hindsight been given the somewhat misleading name of "British Zionism."

In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids and gases. "Ionized" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\n \n\n A Bose–Einstein condensate is a phase of matter formed by bosons cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero. The first such condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman in 1995 at the University of Colorado at Boulder, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvins (nK). Under such conditions, a large fraction of the atoms collapse into the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.\n\n\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter")[1]. The nature of the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identifed by English physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897[2], and dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 [3], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma [4]. Langmuir wrote:\n\n"Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons."[3] \nMore specifically, a plasma is an electrically conductive collection of charged particles that responds collectively to electromagnetic forces. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas) [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely.
Generally no . . . we do not . . . we are old fashion in most cases. We normally believe it is the wives jobs to take care of the household upkeep . . . while we take care of household financial burden.\n\nI know that is old fashioned . . . but that is how men view things. And why marriages in the past lasted for 40-70 years . . . because everyone knew their role in the household.\n\nWith women's lib. and women in the workforce . . . these roles have been skewed. Also, with inflation and the cost of living going up (I blame women's lib and women in the workforce for that too - do research on inflation how it went up from before before women's lib to after women's lib. - I don't have the numbers in front of me anymore . . . but the inflation . . . if I remember correctly . . . multiplied by approx 8 or 9 since women decided to remain in the workforce.)\n\nNow-a-day . . . in some middle-low class families . . . you have to have two income families. And the housework don't get done as it used to.\n\nThat is where the couple need to do analysis on their household participation . . . starting financially . . . \n\nI've discussed it in my other answers . . . and did receive best answers for this analysis on occasion . . . if you want to look at my history.\n\nAlso the best way to get men to help . . . is ask us nicely . . . in a gentle tone. Remember . . . we are as tired as you . . . if not more . . . because of various factors which I have also related to my other answers.

Actually, most fish do have teeth, but the number varies greatly depending on what kind of fish you're talking about, what species, and even what age the fish. The numbers go from zero to tens of thousands.\n\nFor example: The great white shark has 46 teeth in its Front Row Dentition, but there are any number of teeth behind each of those teeth ready to take their place should the front tooth be lost. The cownose ray usually has seven series of teeth on their dental plate in each jaw. Each series has 11 to 13 rows exposed and functional at any one time, fitted into an interlocking pavement of hexagonal, pentagonal and tetragonal shaped flat grinding surfaces. \n\nSome fish not only have teeth along their jaws, but also in the bones on the roof of their mouth (vomerine teeth), and along gill rakers.\n\nFor rabbits, most of them have 2/1 incisors (2 top, 1 bottom), 0 canines, 3/2 premolars and 3/3 molars for a total of 28 teeth. One genus(Pentalagus - the Amami rabbit found only a small island off Japan) has one fewer upper molar on each side, so they have only 26 teeth.\n\nIn toads, the number of teeth is also variable depending on species, but in most the number of teeth is set for each species. It is often used as a characteristic to define a species. Often the teeth of many frogs and toads are very small, barely more than spicules, and not easily visible to the naked eye.

My concept of God is so massive that it is something we cannot fully comprehend. The only way we can comprehend this supreme being is to be apart of this world then move to the next level by dieing. We were meant not to know if there truly is a God. It is part of the test. Some people believe, without a doubt there is a God. They MAY believe we all go to heaven and meet the people who have died before them. I don't think it is as simple as that. What if you were married three times and all your wives died does that mean you hang out in heaven with all three of them? What do we do in "heaven" wander around and chit chat with all the people who died before we got there? There is defiantly more to it than that. But then what if there is no God? What if when we die that's it. The universe is so huge and we are a tiny spec. Why do people think they are so special that there has to be an after life? Is it because we are aware of our existence? I am iffy on who or what my God is but i do feel it is something. I do believe it is something ten times better than what we think it is. It is so much better that if we knew the truth we wouldn't be able to handle it. It would be like the government telling us it is a fact that aliens exist. We would go nuts.

Exothermic and endothermic indicate if the reaction produces or requires energy to take place. It has to do with whether the products have lower or higher energy (respectively) than the reactants.\n\nThe rate of the reaction depends on several factors (like nonscientific mentions). In terms of energy, the rate or reaction and the activation energy are associated via the Arrhenius equation k=A*e^(-Ea/RT).\n\nSo in fact the rate of the reaction will depend on the height of the activation energy (that peak you see in the potential energy diagrams for reactions). It doesn't matter where the level of the products is, only the height of the peak.\n\nA very nice example is the reaction of H2 and O2. As we all know it is extremely exothermic but if you just mix 2 volumes of H2 and 1 of O2 practically nothing will happen. The activation energy is so high that the reaction occurs at an extremely low level and too slow pace for you to see it happening. If you light a match you provide enough energy for several molecules to overcome the high activation energy. Because the reaction releases large amounts of heat this helps more molecules overcome the energy barrier and thus you have a violent (in a way autocatalytic) reaction, leading to an explosion.

How often does God forgive you? Does He limite his forgiveness? Then should we? I don't think so. We are to be imitators of God and Jesus Christ. Although He said 70 X 7, He meant that we are to continually live in forgiveness. It means we are to see others who hurt us as victims of Satan, not just as people out to get us ...

I suggest a high protein low carb diet. You want you body to burn the excess weight, meaning you want your intake of food to produce fat burning This will help since your excercise potential is limited due to your back. Keep a food journal and pay attention to how and when you eat. I suggest cutting out starch altogether. For 14 days .Do the same with fruit Starch-ie bread, pasta, cereal- turns to sugar in your bloodstream as does fruit. And remember that Dairy products are another source of carbs.
I think both are important ... it's important that you are attracted to his personality, but there also needs to be some kind of physical attraction otherwise the relationship is not going to move forward very well.

Really we only have two very general choices. \n1) Stay until either the country is secure, or their own domestic army can protect the country;\n2)Pull out prior to 1)\n\nThe problem with 1) is how will we know when the country is secure? Insurgents claim they will fight till the US leaves, and the US says it will stay till the insurgents are defeated. Seems a bit of a quandry eh? And by who's view of "secure" is the litmus test? By Iraq's standard? By the US's? Make no mistake that those are very different conditions. The US faced the same choice in Viet Nam.\n\nThe problem with 2) is when do you pull out? Right away? Gradually? From where? Chances are as the troops pull out, fighting will get more intense and country wide panic will set in. For comparison read up on the pull out of Viet Nam. It is the spectre of those images, of people crushing against the gates of the US Embassy; of those people running up the stairs of the embassy roof; and of those helicopters being pushed into the sea as more helicopters with evacuees arrived that haunt the US conscious, and exactly why the administration won't think of pulling out. If we pull out one also has to wonder what it was all for? Why did all those soldiers and civilians die if we weren't going to stick around to finish it? If we were just going to pull out then why didn't we do it earlier? It also opens up the administration to charges of incompetency. It will never happen.\n\nAnd as a side note, its getting a little tiring to see all the Republican kids come on here and spout mis-informed opinions (probably because they heard their parents say it). Democrats are "anti-military." Tell that to the Democrats that fought and won World War 2. That was a pretty big anti-military operation there...Dem's also won World War 1. Dem's fought (under UN action) the Korean War. Dem's started Viet Nam escalation (not exactly a crowning achievement but certainly not "anti-military"). It was a Republican that pulled out of Viet Nam. It was Republicans that attacked Panama, Grenada, and Iraq.\n\nSo before you characterize all Democrats by one loud mouth (it would be like me characterizing all Republicans as big-eared coke-heads that can't talk in complete sentences based on Bush) that can't get a joke right, let us review the parties and the countries they have fought:\n\nDemocrats:\n1) Germany x2 (at the height of their military power)\n2) Japan\n3) N. Korea (and China later) (won then fought to stalemate)\n4) Viet Nam \n\nRepublicans:\n1)The US (Civil War)\n2) Viet Nam (lost/pulled out)\n3) Panama\n4) Grenada\n5) Iraq\n\nWho do you think is better with the military?\n\nTo Whip: What does military service have to do with anything? You think that gives you more rights or something?

give us a clue what do you want to know
You're right, if you are skinny, I doubt you have 26% body fat as that would make you overfat.\n\nThere are a couple of online calculators I found (see below), that may give you a rought estimate, but it would be best to have it checked professionally and not by one of those hand held devices.\n\nHowever, just remember if you store all your fat in one area, such as the stomach, it may not be entirely accurate.\n\nHTH : )
Sound is made by vibrations of the air (or other medium). Vibrations are caused by many means, and a gunfire is one of them. It is called "explosion". It moves the air particles at the end of the barrel in random ways, by expulsion of the combusted gun powder gasses and by the movement of the bullet. \n\nThe first reason of the sound is uncontrolled expansion of gasses at the end of the barrel, that cause air particle to vibrate at various frequencies for a short time, while gasses move them apart from one antoher.\n\nThe second reason is the bullet breaking the sound barrier when exiting the barrel. It's average velocity is 450 m/s up to 1200 m/s. If speed of sound at 20oC and 1 atm is cca 340 m/s, it is clear that sound barrier is broken, which causes "boom".\n\nSo, mixture of those two sounds make sound of a gun fire.

I'm sure you know the answer to this is you should see a health professional immediately. There are several reasons you might get dizzy and pass out for awhile; you didn't eat that day, you have some type of virus, you're under stress - to name a few. It could also be something serious. Don't wait, go see someone as soon as you can!

I am gay. I knew I was gay when I was 4, though I didn't know there was even a label for it. I was attracted to men. I went through puberty at 8. By 12, my sexual orientation was fully functional. I had a wonderful childhood. Two loving parents, as perfect a home as you can get in all respects. I was never molested. I was never raped. I was never sexually abused. I had my first ejaculation at the hand of another boy when I was 12 - he was 12. We were equals who happened to have very strong feelings for each other. We were textbook best friends in every other respect. I dated girls in high school because I enjoyed their company, not because I was romantically attracted to them. I married at 19 because that's what we are "supposed" to do. I was married 12 years and we have 2 wonderful kids who are now adults themselves. (19 and 17). After 12 years, we decided that we both needed the freedom to find our own paths in life and we divorced amicably. I have been in a healthy, monogamous gay relationship ever since. My kids are well adjusted and love my partner - they call him Dad2. I have never done drugs, don't drink alcohol, and have never had the desire to smoke. I have never been, or had the desire to, be promiscuous. My parents were born in the early 1920's. They are still alive and kicking with sharp minds and moderately good health. I occasionally go out to gay clubs to dance and socialize. All in all, it's been a very good and rewarding life. Choice? Not likely. At the age of 4 one hardly has enough pieces to comprehend choice, let alone make them. It was always there - at no point did I have to make a conscious choice whether to be gay or not. I just am. Yes, I was married and have kids. Just because I am gay doesn't mean the plumbing doesn't work, or that I am sterile. Sex is simply a biological process, nothing more and nothing less. Love, however, is deeply complicated.
Call me-- 18 and need a guy! (Just kidding) from a girl's perspective I think everyone has good qualities (are you brainy, funny, competitive, cultured, etc.) you've just got to make sure they are visable... and wait, she'll show up, the universe works that way... one final note, guys who are to stressed about finding a girl are usually the least attractive, so be respectful, get to know us as people not just potential gfs
Phantom of the opera. It's about a man who was born with a deformity and lives under an opera house. He teaches a girl, Christine, to sing beautifully, and falls in love with her. Then Christine kind of falls in love with a childhood sweetheart, but the phantom (that's the man under ground) keeps trying to get Christine to himself. In the end, he lets Christine go with Raoul (the childhood sweetheart) out of love. Christine should definitiley ave gone with the phantom. He was so passionate, and he was never loved by anybody. It's my all time favorite because it's so sad, and because it's such a fantastic story, and the music is great. Good enough? Hope it wasn't too long for you!
I do believe that she is in serious need of some love. The person or thing she thinks loves her is only using her for their own selfish needs and she's either too stubborn or too niave to realize this. I shall pray for her. Hopefully God can open her eyes. It's like that saying I heard once, love comes softly. Well God will knock softly on the door to her heart, until she lets him in.

The best advice is to pay off as many debtors away as possible and deal with as few of the remaining ones as possible. So if you own 100$ to 10 people, and 400$ to 2 people, pay off the smaller 100$ loans. Then negotiate with the big lenders and give them a stake in your business and try to see who can be your partner. Try to expand your business partners to people who you trust, and don't go to the bank as they will eat you alive with the interest rates that are common place in Africa 20-30%. Seek out venture capital, make a business plan to investors and see if they can take 20% minority stake in your company. Keep good accounts to show that you are serious with your business transparency to outside investors... \n\nThese are just some tips, again the litte information you give it's hard to help.

Let me say first that a lot of things that you find on the internet are incorrect/outdated. For example: http://www.coolnurse.com/marriage_laws.htm states that in GA a pregnant minor can marry without parental consent. They USED to be able to, but GA has now changed that law and pregnant minors can no longer marry in GA without parental consent.\n\nAnd DON’T run off and get pregnant thinking that you will then be able to get married or obtain permission from a judge to get married, because it’s usually denied. A pregnancy ALONE does not automatically mean that marriage is in the best interest of the minor and is not normally a sufficient enough reason for a judge to override a parents rights/wishes by granting a minor permission to marry when their parents object to it.\n\nAnd as far as emancipation, which is VERY hard to obtain by the way, there are states where emancipation does not give a minor the right to get married. \n\nAt 18 you can get married.
Establishing a great credit rating can be challenging. But there are some steps you can take to significantly improve your rating if you know what to do (and what not to do).\nFor example, don't open up a bunch of low-limit credit cards. Each time someone does a credit check on you, it may affect your actual score (lowering it)... \nI'm not a financial advisor, but I did get some great tips from a reputable one. I really recommend you talk to someone you or your family has already dealt with, like a mortgage broker or loans officer, or even someone at your bank...
1. Check your local library, there are many Books, CDs, and DVDs which will teach you the basics and they are free from the library.\n2. If you have Digital Cable from Comcast, they have free music lessons on the "on-demand " feature, just click on music\n3. Trade: Many local recreation departments and adult education programs have guitar lessons, often if you volunteer to help with office stuff, you can take a class for free.

$12k for 80 more hp is a huge waste of money. First, that is an improvment in hp of about 13% over stock which you probably wouldn't be able to actually feel and which you could probably gte by doing some simple bolt on modifications like intake, exhaust, new spark plugs, a chip, etc. which would cost far less than $12K.\nIf you want to retain your warranty and the driveability/comfort you desire (especially if you bought an SL65) then you wouldn't necessarily do anything to modify it.\nAlso, a mustang would have to be dramatically modified to get into the 8s in 1/4 and I doubt that any of those mustangs in the 8s are actually street legal. \nIf you thought that the SL65 would be the fastest car ever than you may be a little confused. If you want an 8 second car then you should sell the SL and get a mustang and modify it. I would guarantee that it won't have the comfort, driveability and sophistication of the SL. Personally, as a daily driver I would much rather have the SL than the mustang.

I have hunted for more than 40 years, and it took me 15 years of dedicated archery and firearm hunting to bag my first 10 point buck (actually was 12 pointer) and it was during a depredation hunt to control deer numbers on agricultural land. There weren't supposed to be many bucks there, let alone huge ones (mine weighed 220 field dressed). You're quite lucky, but don't let it go to your head. Best results are achieved through knowledge, experience and preparation. Don't count on luck. Good Hunting.

For cartoons, Flash is the pre-eminent application. You can also write programs with Flash utilizing the ActionScript framework. However, these are online programs. Adobe will be releasing the Apollo runtime engine in January to developers and publicly in mid-2007. This runtime will allow for deployment of Rich Internet Applications to the desktop for both offline and online utility. Flex is an enterprise grade version of Flash.\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/apollo\nhttp://www.adobe.com/flex\n\nAs far as programs, the tool/language really depends on what you are attempting to accomplish and on what systems it will be deployed. Visual Basic is probably the largest development platform for Windows. Java is cross-platform. C++ is common application language but is very complex.\n\nGood luck.

It is a hard choice that would be difficult to commit to until you are in that pisition. Teh reality is that adopting an american baby is far harder than going overseas. I am sure many couples go overseas because of the time and hassle it takes here.

There are a few prestigious universities in Asia-Pacific.\n\nBut if I had to recommend only one to a foreign student, it would be the National University of Singapore.\n\nThere are some important factors:\n\n1) Among the Asia-Pacific countries, Singapore scores very highly for its education system. It is a proven system that is admired by even the Americans who have incorporated the Singapore teaching system within their own country, particularly in the way Maths is taught.\n\n2) Proximity to facilities and housing.\nA smaller country like Singapore allows a foreign student who is studying there to spend very little time travelling and commuting. The mass rapid transit system (MRT) is world class and housing is relatively cheaper and abundant because the predominant housing structures in this country are high-rise apartments. Food and supermarkets are around every block. Everything you need is within your neighbourhood. You do not need a car to study in Singapore.\n\n3) Language and racial harmony.\nThis is the number one quality that makes Singapore a top choice for foreign students. Its pristine record for civil orderliness is unrivalled, not only within Asia-Pacific itself, but arguably the whole world. Singapore has a most unique blend of cultures that allows a foreign student of any nationality to blend in and be accepted; it can be likened to a New York City of Asia.\n\n4)The weather and greenery.\nSingapore is Summer 365 days a year. When you look up at the skies, it looks exactly like the blue ones you see in a Hawaii postcard. There is no smog, no industrial pollution. The weather is warm, but bright and sunny. Everywhere you go, it's like a beautiful garden with greenery everywhere.\n\n5) Every student, no matter where he studies, has a clubbing streak.\nSingapore has one of the best clubbing scenes in Asia-Pacific. The world-famous Zouk and Velvet Underground, Clarke Quay area, Ministry of Sound and the beach parties on Palawan Beach are constantly evolving and current. But what makes all of them stand out is that they are clean. The drug culture in Singapore is miniscule, an embarassment almost. That is why alot of foreign parents send their children to study in Singapore; if they can't control them, at least they know they won't get into serious trouble.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to say that the National University of Singapore is my recommendation to you and I have listed some factors you may consider when making your choice. But whatever your final decision, I wish you success in your studies and a bright future ahead. GOOD LUCK!\n\nCheers!\nALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE

If you get a flu shot, you are getting viral particles that have been raised in chicken eggs and inactivated by treatment with formalin.\n\nIf you got the flu mist thing, you get a weakened virus of some sort.\n\nAnyhow, you can feel like garbage after getting the shot because you are experiencing an immune reaction to what was injected (that's the point!), as your body recognizes that something is there that shouldn't be. You don't get the flu because the viral particles are unable to do anything because the of the formalin treatment. This year my arm hurt for an hour or so, but that was all.
Living abroad is a great opportunity that need to be considered carefully. Fear of loosing your friends should not stop you - because any friend lost for an absence of a year is not a friend worth keeping. They could even use the opportunity and visit you!\n\nBefore accepting an au-pair contract though, make sure you understand in full, and agree to, what it means. It is actual work - housecleaning and working with children, and it is at times harder that you can think. If the mom works out of the house, you may also feel alone, and miss your friends all that much more. \nMake sure your situation will be legal! you need a work permit, and a legit health insurance - problems are fast to creep up, and you don't want to find yourself without a place to go, and sick.\nE-mail and talk to your family several times, make sure you discuss all worries you have; keep in mind not only your point of view, but also the family's. Make sure you have a fall-back option - a friend close by, or a plan of what to do - or a credit card to charge a back-home ticket if something really should go bad (it can happen)\n\nUltimately, remember that this is an employment, not an alternative family or friends. Like in all life situations, you may end uup being great friends, but first the employment experience must be a good one.

First, you need to know whether or not your notebook has integrated wireless. If it does, great. Go to the linksys website and let it automatically detect your wireless card and give you a list of compatible software. After that, you can generally do this:\n\nControl Panel -> Network Connections -> Right click on your wireless connection -> Wireless Networks tab -> click to have Windows automatically configure your wireless settings.\n\nThen you should open a browser and connect to your router to configure your wireless settings in your router. Most use Linksys, so if you do, just type http://192.168.1.1 and go.\nThen if you hadn't set your password in it, it defaults to admin/admin. Feel free to change your settings to any secure password you feel like, and apply this password to the wireless connection as soon as your wireless network card picks it up. After that, reboot the router and your notebook, and you should be able to connect.\n\nIf you're still experiencing problems, then you might have conflicting devices. Use device manager to rule this out. Also, connecting to another network not your own is not the best answer. It doesn't provide you with the necessary security while on the internet. If all else fails, call tech support and allow them to help you. :)

Once you realize that, you'd start finding enough and more avenues in that field for sure.\n\nOn the other side, some of the "evergreen" industries you might want to look at, after your Business administration degree (if you are interested) are\n-Bio tech\n-advertising

I work for a staffing firm and may be able to give you some advice. \n\n1) If you are sending in your resume to openings it's probably buried underneath a pile of hundreds of resumes on someone's desk (or on someone's inbox if you emailed it). Sometimes the postings are also just formalities. Some companies have a policy of posting their open jobs even though they already have someone in mind for the position. \n\n2) Post your resume online. You may have already done this, but you can't just post it and assume it's being viewed. You have to understand the nature of these resume search engines. When employers search for resumes online, the "newest" resumes come up first. So if you posted your resume yesterday, your resume will probably come up in the second or third page, and some employers don't even get there. Make it a habit to "refresh" your resume every morning. Change something in it. Something. Anything. Add a word, change a word, add a punctuation mark, whatever. Just change something and hit save. The search engine will then think it's a "new" posting and will come up on top of searches increasing your visibility to potential employers. \n\n3) Network. A lot of jobs are filled via referrals. Depending on your industry, attend professional events, visit exhibits, collect business cards. Use online social networking sites like LinkedIn, Zero Degrees, or Ryze. \n\n4) Depending on where you are and what you do, I may be able to help you out. :)

If you are that unsure, you really should be discussing your feelings with your current steady. He would probably prefer you bring this out into the open instead of stringing him along. You also should be asking yourself which person would make you happier. No matter what decision you come to, being honest with yourself and everyone else involved is key. You risk losing a friend, but in life you are solely responsible for your own happiness.

Research shows that metabolic rate is 4 - 5% lower in those people who do not have this meal, and therefore even with a low calorie intake you will relatively have less chance of losing weight than someone who eats the same calories but has some of those at breakfast time.\nThat's because the breakfast meal acts as a kick start to the metabolism for the rest of the day.\nYou should ensure ensure that you use the mind and your brain sensibly.\nOne classical thing to do is to remove temptation.\nFor instance if you eat as a family you may be used to having serving dishes and having 'just one more spoonful' whilst eating from the serving dish.\nRather than having to stop temptation simply remove temptation by serving on individual plates.\nIn addition try to gradually reduce portion size a little, if done over time you and your body will adjust and losing weight in a sustainable way will be easier to achieve.To approach a diet in the best possible way, you need to be realistic up front about what you will achieve.\nNothing demotivates more than setting really hard targets and not meeting them.\nSome will set a sweeping target such as losing a stone in a few weeks or something else that is just impossible to obtain at least in a healthy way and then give up on the diet disillusioned.\nTherefore you should be sure to set ultra realistic targets at least at the start. When you meet them you will be encouraged. Set small, realistic targets often for the best chance of diet success and continued motivation during the course of your diet.These days, dieting is all the rage. The companies that make the products and books make billions of pounds and dollars a year - it's a massive industry. Which means only one thing - they want it to sound really hard to lose weight, so as you buy their products. But that's where you can go wrong.\nThere is one simple truth to losing weight that you don't need a book to tell you, but it's the only one that matters. If you take in less than you use, there is no way that can gain weight - in fact you will lose weight. All this talk of Atkins Diets and eating no carbohydrate (which is not at all healthy) is not relevant.\nThe two golden rules of losing weight are so breathtakingly simple, yet people spend thousands on expensive dieting videos, expensive diet foods and all sorts.\n(1) You must do decent amounts of exercise. If you can introduce 30 minutes exercise into your daily routine, whether this be a brisk walk, perhaps a swim at lunchtime or a jog at the weekend, and eat the same amount as you always have, after 6 weeks the results will be breathtaking. Not only will you lose weight, you will also feel fantastic.\n(2) Cut out the snacks. If you look at most people's meals, who are not happy with their weight, it's just not true that they are eating meals full of calories. In fact if you just add up their main meals it often adds up to less than the daily calorie limits. So where does it go wrong? SNACKS!!! It's been shown time and again that all the snacking through the day vastly increases the amount of calories that people take in - a bag of crisps here, a chocolate bar there - and before you know it you've added another 1,000 calories to your day's intake.\nSo the second rule is simple - continue to eat your main meals and drinks, breakfast, lunch and dinner. But stop the snacking. You could save as much as 1,000 calories a day like this. It's only when you stop snacking that you probably will realise how often you do snack without realising it. So stay disciplined - you get three lovely meals a day, just cut out the snacking OK?\nIf you follow these two recommendations above for six weeks, you will feel great and have lost weight. And because it is not at all a punishing program, with points or starving or deprivation of certain food types (how could that be healthy?) you will be able to maintain this program long term without too much difficult

Vestigial features (Note to creationists: vestigial does not mean useless, do not bother lying that it does) demonstrate we are not now what we were in our past. Our descending testes is a vestige of our reptilian days. Our quadraped-style backs demonstrate we used to walk on four-legs and are only imperfectly adapted yet to two.\n\nEach and every human on the planet has a gene that would stimulate our hair growth to be as thick as a chimpanzee's, if it were working. It's broken because it has a parasite in it. Remove the parasite and we'd have nice, thick coating of fur. Evolution explains this easily, we evolved from furry ancestors, the parasite is responsible for our current state. Creationism has no explanation for why God would have created us with a broken gene, with a parasite, neither of which we actually want.\n\nOne gene we do want is a Vitamin C gene. Untold masses of people have died throughout history due to lacking a way to make their own vitamin C. But, we do have one. It's just broken. Our primate ancestors lived in fruit rich environments, making their own vitamin C was an unnecessary waste of energy, so a mutation killing the gene was a good thing. Humans do *not* always live in such areas and a vitamin C gene would have saved many, many lives. But instead, we have one broken, broken in EXACTLY the same way that a chimpanzee's is broken. Why were we created wtih a broken vitamin C gene? Why is it broken *exactly* the same way as a chimp's? Still no answer from the creationists.\n\nThe evidence for evolution comes from all directions all the time. The fossils demand evoluion, creationists being unable to explain any aspects of fossils sorting. Biogeography demands evolution. How, after the Flood, did all the animals manage to get back to the areas where their fossils are? Why would they bother? Where are the signs of the massive forest of eucalyptus it would take to get koala from the Ark back to Australia? Scientists can piece together the motion of the continents from species distribution, creationists are left only with pretending it isn't enough.\n\nAs far as the "missing" link goes, this is primarily a press bugaboo. There is no singular missing link. Rather, we have a wide series of very non-missing links. Classic case in point:\n\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html\n\nHere you can see a list of some of the fossil skulls scientists claim are links between humans and the rest of the apes. Creationists have to pretend that there are no transitions, each of those fossils is either "obviously" human or "obviously" ape. But when you look at what they say is "obviously" what, you'll see they cannot even agree on which skulls are "obviously" which. If it was really obvious, wouldn't they agree? Wouldn't they come *close* to agreeing?\n\nThe only thing obvious about that chart is that the skulls really do seem to be transitional and creationist demands for a supposedly missing link are nothing but the equivalent of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and yelling, "DOES NOT" to make the evidence go away.

Don't cut it off... Like the other 2 guys before me said you might try stretching it... I am uncircumcised and I have stretched it a little bit yeah it hurts a little so I would suggest try inserting 2 fingers if you can try slowly spreading you fingers... I know of this one guy no kidding... fit eight fingers in there he told me he started with 4 fingers. But if stretching doesn't work for you you might want to get circumcised (sex should be enjoyable).
A good argument can be made that google is relevant to all five environments but you have to decide which of the environments are relevant to the article. \n\nFor instance, if the article is about competition then google is certainly relevant because it gets about 48% of all searches done on the Internet. This is the highest share so google is beating the competition.
An electrical charge is an imbalance between an atom's positive and negative units (Protrons and electrons). A discharge of electrical energy happens when electrons jump from one atom to on that is differently charged to bring the two atoms closer to a balance. If an atom has more electrons that protons, it is negatively charged. If it has more protons than electrons, then it is positively charged. A charge is always changed by changing the number of electrons. If you change the number of protons, it becomes a nuclear reacation since the change is happening in the nucleus of the atom.

If you have ever seen something called the "Kinsey Scale," it describes people who are mostly attracted to one sex and somewhat attracted to the other. Judging by everything you say here, it really can't be said what, of those two labels, you are. You seem to find women more sexually attractive, but men more romantically interesting. Frankly, I think you are putting too much stock in the label. While I know it can be hard not having a set identity, you should just be with someone who you find BOTH sexually and romantically interesting and who treats you right, whether they are a man or a woman. If you really need a label for your peace of mind, I would say you are bisexual, but you are also rather young, give yourself time to figure yourself out. You already understand one point better than most. You know it is not all about sex and sexual attraction, otherwise you would have settled this question a while ago. Just give yourself time, you don't need to know every last little thing about yourself by the time you finish high school, trust me.

I quit for three weeks before and could have stayed quit except I gave into a thought to get a pack when I was really stressed out.\nI regret that move. It only took one cigarette to get me hooked again. I can tell you that to be smoke free for three weeks, what I did was pray and ask God to help me. I said, I can't do this on my own, and I am asking for help. So, I threw the half filled pack in the trash and didn't smoke for three weeks. So, if you have decided to quit that you're sick of the habit I know you can do it, just be prepared for the thoughts like I had and don't give in to them. I wish you all the best...

Hello I think what you should do is give her hints that you like her more than friends action speaks louder than words and soon enough she'll get the hint and , you will eventually know if she likes you the same way ,because she will react on it, you will soon know if she likes you more than friends, if you tell her how you feel and she dont feel the same way towards you might loose her as well by making her feel uncomfortable around you, so you dont want to do that, at least by giving her hints you will get the answer without asking her or making her feel awkward.\nTake care and Goodluck

Society tells people that their idea of beauty is a size 7 and blonde. They look down on full figured women as those who have no will power to control their eating and that they need to go on a diet. I've seen some beautiful full figured women and they rock some outfits these skinny chicks can't even surpass. I get stares too when I eat as if I am not entitled to eat a good meal. I've had men compliment me for being sexy at my size and not looking like a bag of bones, but someone who can sit down and get down on a meal like everyone else. I am working on taking some weight down, but even at my size I have guys who say I am fat and ugly when I am not worried about what they think since it's their ignorance doing the talking. I see so many guys pass over a beautiful and intelligent full figured woman for one of these skinny ditzy bimbos just so their friends won't laugh at them.\n\nThe sad thing is that a lot of these skinny females don't help things when they get together with their friends and start gawking and laughing at larger women for the fact that they can't get into certain outfits like baby tees and other clothes. Yet they get mad when a BBW gets attention from an attractive man, I had that happen to me before these narrow minded white girls making fun of me for not being able to fit into their clothes, yet I got more attention from the guys who saw me well dressed and put together and not sloppy like these girls were. It's up to us to write the media and start voicing our concerns to them about the images they put out there telling both men and women that certain traits and looks are what will make you more popular.\n\nWhat happened to the power of diversity and the unique world we live in, but it won't be that way when we have the film, fashion and music industry defining to us what is beautiful and what is considered sexy. I think the anorexic look has got to go because what man will find some woman with her bones petruding to be sexy? I agree I want to lose the weight without surgery or dangerous drugs. Too many women are not celebrating what God gave them and to accept themselves for how God made them. I have no problem with being a full figured woman since I get mad compliments for the way I carry myself and the stylish clothes I wear and being a lady and not being too out there.\n\nAs a full figured woman I am given mad respect for not looking like a dog's chew toy which is what my guy friends refer to skinny women as because I look like a real woman not some starving scarecrow trying to be cute. Do your thing and who cares if some people don't like women like us and are only aiming for eye candy because in the end they're losing out on getting to know a really great person who's full of wonderful, thoughts, ideas, and a sense of humor to match.\n\nA lot of men miss out on good women when they pass them over for not having the physical part down meaning she's a size 9. You would be surprised at how many men want to date women like you and me, but don't worry you're a good woman and there's men out there who would be honored to be with a beautiful woman who's got class and style and a great personality. Only ignorant people will base their opinion of what society feels is considered the ideal woman. It's up to us to change the way people think about others especially for their differences and accept the fact that women come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and ethnic backgrounds.

Although Cromwell had no military training, his experience as a large landowner gave him a good knowledge of horses. Cromwell became convinced that if he could produce a well-disciplined army he could defeat Prince Rupert and his Cavaliers\n\nCromwell trained his cavalry to keep together after a charge. In this way his men could repeatedly charge the Cavaliers. Cromwell's new cavalry took part in its first major battle at Marston Moor in Yorkshire in July 1644. The king's soldiers were heavily defeated in the battle. Cromwell's soldiers became known as the Ironsides because of the way they cut through the Cavaliers on the battlefield.\n\nThe Parliamentary forces were also able to capture the Royalist baggage train that contained his complete stock of guns and ammunition. \n\nThe Battle of Naseby was the turning point in the war. After Naseby, Charles was never able to raise another army strong enough to defeat the parliamentary army in a major battle.
under a sonogram, the dr can see where the instruments are going and will be less likely to puntcure the uterus, or any other organ wall, and he/she can also see that the entire fetus is removed. this is a very contriversual area for debate, and a woman should have the choice to have an abortion, and of course then there will be drs. to do it, where there is a need, there is a means, remember the roe vs wade case, before that, women got abortions in dirty attacks, sometimes with coathangers not even by a dr. of course, this should not be a means of birthcontrol,

So, your cervical spine (top of back) is misaligned, thoracic (middle) spine is sprained, and lumbar is herniated. First they do conservative methods with meds and physical therapy. Do whatever you can before you opt for surgery. They usually do it when the bulge finally ruptures. The ortho companies are getting better with new products, but your spine is never the same and you usually wind up having more surgery. I had a herniated disk at L5-S1. My right leg went numb. Started at the hip and eventually went down to my toes. Could not walk or drive. I ended up having 2 nerve blocks. After the 2nd, I have been doing my exercises and not abusing my back. I sit working all day and have to get up very often and "stretch." I have been fine since. \nA chiropractor usually fixes the subluxations, but if you are hurting all down your spine, that may be scary. You either like chiropractors or you do not. There is no middle ground. I was pushed to try it and it made things worse. I have friends who live for them. Good luck.

No, neither arizona elegans, nor its close cousin, Arizona occidentalis are venomous. Both are constrictors that prey on rodents and small reptiles and are considered harmless to humans. They are also largely nocturnal and thus not frequently seen (I've never seen one in many years of roaming around the SW deserts where the live).\n\nThe only venomous snakes found in the Southwest US are the many types of rattlesnakes and the rarely-seen coral snake. We also have the country's only venomous lizard - the large and odd-looking Gila Monster (also rarely seen).

A buddy of mine watches the show and got me into it as he was telling me the story, and the Sasuke character rocks. I've always found that the second, or co-lead characters in either anime or American comics tend to have a little more depth and interesting background story than the lead. Primarily I believe this fact exist because the creator is trying to give the co-leads some audience appeal, from Sasuke's outfit color combination to his fighting abilities and origin this character is off the chain.\nPeace.

I was in a long distance relationship at one point. We talked online, and on the phone all the time. Occasionally, we visited each other. Finally, he moved to my town to find a job but he could so I moved and left all my family back to his town. I was 18 at the time and he was 19. We got married and soon after I became pregnant. Before my son was born we moved back to my town thank goodness. Now, I have to tell you that we did not get to know each other good enough. We have a lot of problems to this day. Our lifestyles were so different. We've been married a little over a year now but have many problems. Just beware and get to know the person well before making any commitments.

She opened it and found a brand new bathroom scale. \n\nFuneral services for Ed have been scheduled for Friday.xxx

I think it is pathetic, there is no need to abuse anyone or anything, yes we all get angry and maybe say things we regret but if we realize our faults thats a start to maybe containing a little if not all the selfcontrol we have. Its all about teaching not only math, english, science etc. but teaching at a young age what selfcontrol is and how inportant it is. We are not perfect in my household but we do stress selfcontrol.
Its a cliche. Its like why people have to wear like Polo or Nautica or have Coach purses. Its a cliche and its a style they "want' and they think they "need" \n\nWomen think that they feel secure with a man in the military, when in reality, we're just another guy. Yeah we work in bigger "corporations" where we have weapons, and special traning blah bah blah, but in reality, hello? we're just men. Men are men no matter what. \n\nAgain, NOt all military guys are a ss holes. And not all of them are jerks. you have to be the judge of that. No way you can just judge them on their uniform. And think, "wow that guy has a lot of medals, he must be really good." Sorry it doesn't work that way. \n\nWomen, no offense I think in my own opinion, they just want to be flattered. Have bragging rights, yeah my bf was in the military or is in the military and he's some big guy. Kind of in those ways.

the taste and smell of sperm relates to what you eat and go with your body like you said. Healthy sperm does have a more distinct flavor than toxic sperm. They do make pills you can get on the net that are highly concentrated fruit poweder, so your man's cum, if he eats the pilss 2 hours before sex, can tast like bannana or oranges. You can also eat lots of those fruits and your cum will taste sweet and smell good.

Bacteria are everywhere. There's many many ways bacteria grows in and on meat in particular, because it's an excellent protein source for growth. \n\nContamination can come from dirty utensils used to cut and prepare the meat, as well as surface tops, cutting boards, ect..\nAlso, through airborne particles, dirty hands of the person preparing the meat, or even breathing over the meat while it's being prepared. Also, the animal could have bacteria already in it's system, which is more than likely usually the case. Animals and humans have billions of bacteria in our intestinal tract especially. You even have bacteria known as "normal flora" on your skin right now! \nMany times, contamination occurs in meat when it is processed in slaughterhouses, because fecal matter from the intestinal tract gets mixed with the meat (sounds gross, but that's where E. Coli comes from, as well as some forms of Serratia) \nThe FDA and USDA actually run tests on the meat before it is sent out though to make sure it isn't contaminated. They normally do something called a spread plate count or dilution count. This is where they put a certain quantity of meat, grind it up, mix with sterile water in a sterile blender type instrument and add maybe a milliliter of the substance to test tubes of water that have a measured amount of water in it, and it then gets diluted further the same way in about 4 test tubes. The first would be a 1:10 ratio, then 1:100, 1:1000, ect.. Then, usually about a milliliter is taken out from those tubes and put on a petri dish with a special type of nutrient agar for the bacteria to form colonies. After the plates are incubated, they are removed and you count the colonies of bacterial growth. Then they do a mathematical calculation where they take the colonies seen and multiply it by the dilution factor, this gives them the colony formula units. If the CFU is over a certain amount per gram, then it is discarded or recalled. To test for E. Coli in particular, they use something called EMB agar, which is diluted sheep red blood cells. The bacteria is spread onto the petri dish of this agar, and then incubated. If the petri dish has a bright, metallic green colony growth, it is positive for E. Coli.

I don't think US laws favor the "criminals". It's just that one can never know with 100% certainty who is really guilty and who is really innocent, and that introduces a lot of human error into the process. Here are some problems with the American legal system:\n\n-Many states have different types of jail sentences, ranging from very short jail sentences for pretty serious crimes to very long sentences for relatively "minor" ones (such as the "three strikes" laws in states like Texas and California). These discrepancies mean that you might go to jail for life in Texas because you were caught a third time with a small quantity of an illicit drug but might only spend ten years for murder in one of the more liberal New England states.\n-Often, your legal counsel is nowhere near as important as jury selection. In the OJ case, for example, had the jury been majority white (as opposed to majority black) it is highly likely that OJ would have been convicted. Jury demographics matter a lot. Juries also are relatively poorly educated and have short attention spans. Studies have shown that juries are often more moved by courtroom theatrics and good-looking lawyers and defendants than they are by facts. Good-looking people tend to get more "fair" trials than bad looking people. And race is also involved (white juries will be more inclined to convict a black man than a white one).\n-The Supreme Court has shifted from a more liberal stance to a more conservative one. For example, while the liberal Court of the 1960s and 1970s gave us "Miranda" rights, the more conservative Rehnquist Court has tended to side with police and law enforcement. Whereas a defendant might once have gotten off the hook if evidence was obtained without a warrant or if a legal "technicality" was breached, nowadays the courts give a lot more leeway to law enforcement (for example, police might come to a person's house with a warrant to search for illegal firearms and arrest a person on the possession of illicit drugs- even if drugs were not specified in the warrant). With the Patriot Act and now wire tapping, the Federal givernment has immensely expanded its ability to search individuals without court warrants. It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will weigh in on these measures and whether or not it will deem them un-Constitutional.

Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia, reference work that provides information on a range of subjects. Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest, or they can focus on a particular field of study, such as a geographic area, an ethnic group, a time period, or an academic discipline. Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles, each addressing a distinct topic. Many of the articles contain illustrations, maps, photographs, and other media elements that help readers understand concepts. For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books, but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats, such as CD-ROM, digital video disc (DVD), and on the Internet. \n\nThe term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia, meaning “comprehensive education” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge, or a comprehensive education in a specific subject. This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work, in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically. Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago, although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century.

Romanov (rō'mənŏf, Rus. rəmä'nəf) , ruling dynasty of Russia from 1613 to 1917. The name Romanov was adopted in the 16th cent. by a family of boyars (great nobles) that traced its beginnings to the 14th cent. Czar Ivan IV took as his first wife Anastasia Romanov. Anastasia's brother, Nikita, was a regent for her son, Czar Feodor I. Nikita's son, Philaret, whom Boris Godunov forced to take monastic vows, was patriarch of Moscow from 1619 until his death in 1633. Michael, Philaret's son, was chosen in 1613 as czar of Russia; his election ended a turbulent period in Russian history. Except for the period from 1722 to 1797, the succession was thereafter regulated by the law of primogeniture.\nThe direct successors of Michael were Alexis (1645–76) and Feodor III (1676–82). Ivan V and Peter I (Peter the Great) reigned jointly under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna until 1689, when Peter assumed sole rule. In 1721, Peter took the title emperor of Russia in addition to that of czar; the new title was borne by all his successors. His succession decree of 1722 denounced the law of primogeniture and declared that the choice of a successor lay solely with the ruling emperor.\n\nIn 1723, Peter made his consort joint ruler as Catherine I, and after his death (1725) she continued to rule until she died in 1727. Peter's son by his first marriage, Czarevich Alexis, had been executed in 1718. His second marriage, with Catherine, produced two daughters: Anna, who married Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, and Elizabeth. They were bypassed in the succession of 1727 in favor of Peter II (1727–30), son of Czarevich Alexis.\n\nPeter II was the last of the direct male Romanov line, and on his death Anna, duchess of Courland, a daughter of Ivan V, ascended the throne. She died without heirs and was succeeded (1740) by Ivan VI, a great-grandson of Ivan V. He was a German, son of the duke of Brunswick and of Anna Leopoldovna, a princess of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe rule of foreigners was unpopular, and Peter I's daughter Elizabeth executed a coup in 1741 and was proclaimed czarina. Her nephew Peter III succeeded her in 1762 but was deposed (and probably assassinated) that year in a coup that made his consort, a princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, empress as Catherine II (Catherine the Great). There was some argument as to the paternity of Catherine's son and successor, Paul I (1796–1801), but it is now generally believed that he was the son of Peter III.\n\nPaul, who was assassinated, restored the succession by primogeniture in 1797. His successors reigned as Alexander I (1801–25), Nicholas I (1825–55), Alexander II (1855–81; assassinated), Alexander III (1881–94), and Nicholas II (1894–1917). The marriage of Nicholas II to Princess Alix of Hesse (Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna) brought hemophilia into the family; their son, Czarevich Alexis (1904–18), was afflicted with the disease. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Nicholas II and his immediate family were executed. The members of the Romanov family who escaped execution fled abroad.

As thhe "air" in airplane implies, airplanes need air to fly. Their engines are designed to take in air, mix it with fuel and combust it to produce energy for propellers or jet engine thrust. Although many jetliners can operate at very high altitudes in thin air they can not operate within the near perfect vacuum of space with no air (oxygen) at all. Also, airplanes are propelled through air using wings (air foils) that give the airplane lift and control. There would be no lift or control within the vacuum of space.\n\nRockets and spacecraft on the other hand contain their own fuel and liquid oxygen (or other chemicals) that produce enormous thrust. They can not "fly" in air although some can glide to return to earth.

One of the biggest misconceptions is that doing sit ups will make you lose fat around your waste. Not gonna happen.\n\nA diet is the only thing to help that. Now doing those sit ups is going to help burn fat. But so will the stepper or tread mill. Cardo training along with a good diet is your best bet to burn off the fat.\n\nI would recommend cutting calories, fat and carbs from your diet as much as possible. I had a chart cant find it, but if you look around on the net. You can find the right amount of calories to body weight to help you get a target of what you should be doing.

There are many causes for penis curvature. These include weak and poor development of the penis, wearing restrictive underwear, a penis injury or some form of damage to the penis, age, over-masturbation resulting in trauma to the penis causing scar tissue to form and thus causing the penis to gradually curve, twist, or bend. Other results include the penis being out of shape or deformed, such as one part being thicker or thinner than another part. A slight curve such as to only 15 degrees, however, is normal.

It depends on how you define "greatest". Would Babe Ruth be a great ballplayer in 2006? He'd probably be nothing special. \n\nToday's players benefit from nutritional guidance, weight lifting and fitness programs, better travel conditions, and countless other things that players from Ruth's era could never have dreamed of. (Not to mention illegal pharmaceutical additives, in some cases.)\n\nRuth also played in an 8 team league (I believe it was 8), so instead of the 600 best baseball players, he only played against 200. Higher quality players.\n\nOn the other hand, players of Ruth's era only played against white ballplayers; there were no blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or other ethnic groups or foreigners playing in baseball. One could argue that that diminished the quality of the game. \n\nPerhaps the quantity of players and the lack of mixed ethnicity cancel each other out. We'll never know.\n\nTo me, Ruth is the greatest, though Mays and DiMaggio and several others are certainly in contention. Ruth is the greatest because of what he did in comparison to the other players of his day. He didn't just break records by a 5 or 6%, he broke them by doubling the old record. He'd hit as many home runs in a season as entire other teams.\n\nAnd by that definition he was head, shoulders, chest, and waist above the other players of his era. To me that makes him the best.\n\nIn addition, he was larger than life. He brought a lot of good attention to the game, and is probably to a degree responsible for the success of the game over the last 100 years. I am not sure you can say that about any particular players who followed him.\n\nBut there are valid arguments for Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and others. That's what's great about baseball; there is no right answer.\n\n--Cloyd

President Wilson was completely devastated by World War I, but even more so after the war. He wanted to create the league of nations to prevent another world war, but the American public didn't go along with the idea. So Wilson toured all over the United States to garner support, but to no avail. The senate confirmation bill to ratified the league of nations was voted down. Afterward, he lived a life of a ghost, finally dead a year later, a broken man.\n\nFor Roosevelt, he wanted to realize his goal of the four world policeman to prevent another world war. He had litte doubt that the allies would win the war. Therefore, he focused most of his efforts with secret diplomacy with Stalin, the best known being the "blue pencil" agreement. Stalin always carried a blue pencil around. When Roosevelt was discussing post war world with Stalin, Stalin took out a pencil and basically draw out parts of Eastern Europe as the Soviet sphere, American sphere and British sphere. However, Roosevelt never saw his plans become reality and he kept all of it secret from his vice president, Harry Truman.

I also get a back ache from most chairs causing you to lean forward. I tested about 20 chairs before I found the right one for my computer desk I think alot of it has to do with being able to adjust the height right for you. I think they should make adjustable desks or chairs as everyone is different in height, weight, and posture.
Being in a situation where you have no choice but to learn the language is the fastest way to learn, but if you listen to the music (works best if you choose a song you like listening to) and can find a web site that has translations for the lyrics, you can learn whole dialogs and conversational pronunciation. Just finding an English version of the song will not help as well because artists may have to change lyrics or verses to maintain the flow of the song as opposed to the meaning of the words.

Omg yes! It was purely by luck, though. When "Miss Congeniality" was shot in San Antonio for the Miss United States portion of the movie, there is a scene where Sandra Bullock jumps a guy with a cowboy hat because she thinks he has a gun (it's really a lighter). Well right before that, they show the crowd, and I'm one of the extras in the background with my Dad who is wearing a blue shirt and cowboy hat! It was awesome!!!

If you're of average height for your age, you're not fat. You're probably in very nice shape!\n\nHowever, what other people think or tell you won't change your mental image. Part of what makes you feel that way is that your body is changing from that of a girl to that of a woman. You're getting curves in all the right places, and developing a figure. It's a great thing, but it may take time to get comfortable with getting, like..old, gurl ;-)\n\nIf your weight is becoming an obsession, where you feel that you have to lose weight to look "good", then you should probably talk to an adult about it. If you don't feel that you can talk to your parents, then maybe an adult friend, a school counselor... If the feeling continues, it can lead to anorexia, bulimia, and all the complications that result from those - even death.
Ive always liked using shaving cream. Glove oil is oil based, while shaving cream is water based, so the shaving cream will evaporate, leaving the glove softer. After that, I put a ball in my glove and wrap it in a rubber band... the classic trick.

Ice cream headache: A headache that occurs when one puts ice, a cold food or chilled beverage in the mouth. Ice cream is by far the most frequent offender. The headache occurs regardless of whether or not the individual suffers from other types of headache, such as migraine. \n\nIce cream headache is characterized by a stabbing, aching pain that begins a few seconds after ingestion of something cold. The pain peaks in 30 to 60 seconds. It is usually located in the midfrontal area (in the middle of the forehead) but may be in the temporal or retro-orbital region (behind the eye). The headache may be accompanied by a toothache. The pain rarely lasts for more a few minutes, if that long. \n\nNo treatment is required for an ice cream headache and it is not necessary to stop eating ice cream. The headache can be "headed off" by keeping cold foods and icy beverages away from the back of the palate (the roof of the mouth). The pain of an ice cream headache is a form of referred pain. It is referred from palate where it is triggered to the head and sometimes the teeth. AKA BRAIN FREEZE!

Illegal immigration cuts into the wages of American workers. \nAccording to Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), who is head of the \nCongressional Immigration Reform Caucus,\n \n"Massive immigration of low-skilled, low-wage workers ... \ndepresses wage rates for people who are at the low economic end of the scale. ... \nThe overall effect will be the decline of the living standard of every American, \nor most Americans."\n\nAccording to TNRIP, the financial cost of this foreign invasion to U.S. taxpayers \nis staggering! Here is a break down of the annual costs: \n\nEducation: $22.5 billion\nBi-lingual Education: $3.3 billion\nAFDC: $2.4 billion\nSSI: $2.9 billion\nSocial Security: $24.8 billion\nHousing Assistance: $2.6 billion\nCriminal Justice: $2.6 billion\nJobs Lost by Americans: $10.8 billion\nOther Programs: $51.4 billion\nFood Stamps: $7 billion\nHealth Care: $1.4 billion \n\nhttp://prisonplanet.com/articles/april2006/050406_b_Immigration.htm\n\nThis Is ECONOMIC TERRORISM\n\nTo illustrate the absurdity of a "comprehensive" approach to ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS , and the more radical of the ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT advocates who are proponents of an "open borders" policy. We don't take a comprehensive, humane approach with drug dealers because they are breaking our laws and causing great damage to this country by poisoning our children. Similarly, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS violate our laws and Poison our system of Economics by TAKING JOBS from American Workers, Keeping WAGES ARTIFICIALLY LOW, and Sucking MILLIONS of Dollars of TAXPAYERS MONEY out of our Welfare and Medical Systems. \nNot To Mention The Fact That A Majority Of ILLEGAL ALIENS Live And Work In This Country And Then Send Their Money Back Home To Their Families (Whatever Nation Their Families Live In) Therefore DRAINING The Economy Even Further. \nWhen The US Dollar Leaves The US...

This is a horrible situation to be in and believe it or not there are a lot of girls out there so jealous of a guys good relationship with his family that they do everything in their power to put a stop to that. Your brother will get over this infatuation, because thats alll it is, and when he comes to his senses he will realise that this girls jealousy and possessive, manipulative, self obsessed but insecure nature is coming between him and the people that have supported and cared for him his whole life. Blood is thicker than water. If he truly loves this girl however he will want yer acceptance, life is nothing without a secure loving family unit which ye seem to have. Until he realises this however ye have to make the first move. No matter how much ye despise this girl ye muct accept that for now, they are together. Arrange a family meal and invite her. Show her that the concept of a loving family does exist as it seems that she doesn't understand that. Be open and friendly towards her and make her feel wanted, your brother will respect this and if he feels that she is accepted then hopefully ye will become close again. I wish you the best of luck and hope that my advice is of some help.
Here I am! I have all the characteristics that I didn't when I was young and dumb. Now I'm mature and wise and young enough to still have a family.

Improves Concentration \nAt work, chewing gum helps us concentrate on the task at hand. Many truck drivers find that chewing gum helps them stay alert at the wheel. \n\nEases Tension \nAs early as 1939, scientific studies showed how chewing reduces muscular tension and helps people feel more at ease. Because it is so well-recognized for helping stay alert at the same time it eases tension, the U.S. Armed Forces have supplied chewing gum to its soldiers ever since World War I. It is still included in field and combat rations today. \n\nFreshens Breath \nChewing gum, especially a mint-flavored gum like Wrigley's Spearmint or Doublemint, moistens and refreshes the mouth and throat and sweetens the breath. \n\nHelps Fight Tooth Decay \nAfter meals, it isn't always convenient to use a toothbrush. Chewing gum stimulates the production of saliva, which helps neutralize acids from foods that may cause tooth decay.

Hi! The question should be, "why do we fall in love and become fools?" Actually, in my own opinion, it is not just fools who falls in love but everyone falls in love as well.. even the brightest man/woman became fools when love hit them. We don't and can't control it. It just happen. Sometimes, we do stupid things when we're in love. We follow our hearts than following our minds that is why we are like fools in the end.

They don't want it to fall. I have been there, they have super huge concrete anchors on one side, and the tower is anchored to them with big metal ties. They have counterweights up on the top of the tower to weigh it in the opposite direction. They tried digging under it to reinforce the foundation, but it almost fell over. You cannot go up in it any more either, that was a bummer.

It is true, many pastors do not have all of the answers to all of the questions, but those who say, "Ask your pastor," probably do not know either. It can not hurt to get a pastor's opinion though. Being a pastor, I would hope you would understand this and give your opinion, stating it is your opinion, and them help them to seek out the answer for themselves as well as yourself. In this way, you would be able to help the next person with the same answer. We, as a people, always need to strive to for excellence. This especially includes our religious beliefs. I am always willing to help those who come to me for help, but if I do not know how to answer them, I refer them to my pastor. If he does not know the answer, I would imagine he either finds it or tries to find someone to help him. After all, no one is perfect and no one has all of the answers.\nAlso, I never ever take the pastor's word for anything I hear him say. I have heard pastors misquote the Bible, misinterpret scriptures and many other things from behind the pulpit. I always enter a church service with an open mind, but an educated mind.

K out of those that answered I can honestly say that I am the most qualified to give advice on this one LOL no disrespect to you folks. Okay, a shin splint is where some of your muscles on one side of your leg become stronger than the adjacent mucsles on the other side whereby the mucsles are acually pulling away from the bone. Extremely painful in some instances, I've been a track runner for many years and at one point I would acually cry after practice. This was in college mind you. \n\nSo what to do, first of all stretch. Probably the most important thing you can do, before engaging in any physical activity especially involving any amount of running is STRETCH. Stretch your hamstrings, quads, and glutes. Stretch your gastrochnemious IE CALVES and your feet. Stretch everytime, perhaps two times a day for five mins at a time. Warm up a bit, get the blood flowing perhaps from a brisk walk or very light jog, and then stretch.\n\nK, so now that I emphasized stretching LOL, now use a heating pad or something warm to massage your sore shins BEFORE exercise. Don't ever ice before engaging in physcal activity, this will lead you to be more prone to injury!\n\nAlways use the heating pad or ice for twenty mins, no longer and no shorter twenty mins. After icing, allow the numbness to dissapate before walking. Don't switch back and forth either. \n\nWarm before exercise\n\nIce afterward.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAlso you might want to get some foam pads to insert into your shoes, helped me get through track season one year.\n\nAlso if you can, avoid running on concrete and asphalt (hard surfaces) look to running on a well finished track or nice green plush grass:) Good Luck! Hope I helped

Absolutely. Don't think about it-just do it.
Families,especially parents, like to raise you in their likeness. Therefore, they don't understand when you become independent and are able to think on your own developing your own ideolgy of things. I think you should always be true to yourself and your beliefs. I also believe in God and No One can tell me any different. Even of they are my family members. Just ask for their respect as you will give them yours. It takes a strong person to sometimes stand up and take a stand about something they believe in. If you believe in God you know that all things are possible in him. Good luck, stand tall, and believe in yourself.

You can try, there might be a few smaller colleges out there or state schools. If not, go to the 2 year college, ace all of your classes and then transfer out. Even if you don't get a's in all your classes but do well, there will definitly be a school that will accept you. If you trransfer, no one is going to care about your SAT ever again. And you can always try taking them over again. Rolling admissions can go until March and you can probably talk to your guidance counselor about informing the colleges you have applied to or are going to apply to that you will be taking the test again. I believe the college board is offering another test in December, so you can sign up for that one jst go to their website. If you want to know what colleges you might have a shot at, go to the princetonreview.com they have this neat little thing where you enter in all your stats and then the name of a college and it tells you what kind of chance you have at getting in.

When writing an essay, think of it in 3 stages - beginning, middle and end. The beginning is an introduction to the reader of the subject you're writing about, the middle is an elaboration of the introduction with facts, case studies, etc, and the end is a summary/conclusion of your subject matter to round off the essay. Hope this helps.
I've been in and out of therapy since I was 6 (I'm now 30) and DBT is the most helpful thing I have ever tried. I am a major advocate for it, I wish it was more widely offered.\nFor me, I always knew something was wrong but didn't know what or why or what to do about it. DBT lays it all out in a way that makes sense. It teaches the skills for being able to make real changes in your life. If you are ready to really face your issues and take a very honest look at yourself, then I highly recommend it. It truly can change your life and significantly reduce suffering. \nThe only negative thing I have heard about it have been due to the individual not liking the way the group was run, which had more to do with the people running it than the content. \n\nI would say, if you can get into DBT, do it. Try it. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. It is very worth the effort. I wish I had been introduced to it at 18, I think my life would have gone a lot differently if I had.\n\nFor more info try these websites (the first will let you read what other people who have tried it have to say about it, the second will show you what it actually is) :\n\nwww.remedyfind.com\nwww.dbtselfhelp.com\n\nIf you want any more information on bpd or dbt, feel free to email me.

if you really WANT THIS BAD then your gonna have to WORK HARD FOR IT. not just think "oh if i skip this meal then i can have a chocolate cake for dessert". or if your gonna end up giving up why even try to lose weight? first of all you need to watch what ur eating. no more snacking on all that unhealthy stuff. eat an apple if your hungry. next you need to start excercising. taking a jog every day will help. enrolling in a hot yoga class could help too. hot yoga is when you do yoga in a very hot room and you lose weight much faster.
First of all,actors do have to go to castings...We usually think that just because they are already famous or well known, they always get called for parts. that is far from the truth..\nSome screen writers make characters having a specific actor in mind, like for example Tarantino that usually wants an actor in specific...but most of the time..managers get the screenplay(movie) and contact there actor and make them do the casting for that part.some actors get it..some dont...you can be a great actor but if another one makes the role of a "retard" just a little bit better that you,then you know who will most likely win the part.
My only suggestion to resolve this matter for "free" is to go down to your local library. They should have all of the newspapers on microfilche or microfilm and from there you could begin searching for your fathers death notice or any info that was published. Once you figure the exact date and time then you can attempt to contact your local city hall or county clerks office and request the death certificate. It is all part of public record. If there were any criminal charges you can also check with the court system in your area and they will guide you in the right direction.
I do hope that you're referring to phone technicians.\n\nPersonally, I avoid telling customers to reinstall as much as possible. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should need to reformat their machine over a virus. Absolutely none.\n\nViruses are the easiest to blame though because everyone knows what a virus is. If a phone tech tells you that you have malware or spyware, it's going to raise a lot of questions from you about removing it that he may not be capable of answering.\n\nPhone techs are paid by the call btw, not by the answers given.
What is really visible and clear now that all companies left the flag of NO TRUST,\nthis is what i can feel rightnow,\nThis happens all the time with all people, honest and nonhonest,\nbut there's a trend now in management that smart manager who can put his subordinates under full control, making them feel like they are all thievs all the time,\nso that, nobody even think of making something wrong,\n\nbut for you,\nget him what he wants to prove you went there,\nand then, tell him you're dealing with a senior manager, not a junior fresh graduate !!!!\nIt's not a normal procedure to act like this with me
Edema is an observable swelling from fluid accumulation in certain body tissues. Edema most commonly occurs in the feet and legs, where it also is referred to as peripheral edema. The swelling is the result of the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within the tissues that are outside of the blood vessels.\n\nHeart failure often causes edema. Congestive heart failure or CHF is the bunch of symptoms that hit you when your heart can't pump enough blood to satisfy your body's needs.
Hi, Velehrad (meaning Big Castle) is one of the most important pilgrim sites in the Czech Republic. The place belonged to the Great Moravian Empire to where St Cyril and St Methodius brought alphabet and the Bible in a Slavonic language so the locals would understand it. They actually brought Christianity to the Moravian part of what today is the Czech Republic.\nThere is a huge complex of church buildings including monastery (belonging among the biggest European ones) in Velehrad, originating from 13th century. There are pics of the interiors and exteriors here: http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:_f7X2WicmSkJ:www.ado.cz/poutni/velehrad/velehrad.htm+Velehrad&hl=cs&ct=clnk&cd=3, http://www.velehrad.cz/vel1.html\nYou can read about it in English here: http://www.heartofeurope.cz/regions_5.html

You need to quit giving him anything. He doesn't deserve your heart. You need to feel like the queen of the world if you are carrying his unborn child.

Bad sectors will appear if a drive is constantly rewriting the same place over and over again, such as on a badly fragmented partition. Bad sectors appearing more often than every four months is a sign to start backing up data. \n\nWhen in doubt, buy a new drive. If you can live with a small size (20GB or less) you can find unused ones on the cheap to put into old PCs. If you buy two and use them as a slave for data and master for programs, it's easy to replace in the future.\n\nIf you buy a new and larger drive, partition it with programs on one partition and data on another (say, 30/30 on a 60GB drive). It will make tracking sector errors easier down the road.
Ok, well yesterday I had a reason to be moody!! I went to the dealership that advertised selling vehicles for as little as $5.00~figured it would be a gimmick. When I got there, there was a select number of different vehicles (in really great condition) that had the green balloons floating from them. The deal was if you were sitting in one of these vehicles at 10:00, you get the deal. Well, I have 3 kids and one more on the way, and 2 step-kids. Ya, a lot, I know, and that's why I was looking at a '03 Ford Windstar (ya, a mini-van) with 94,000 miles. Well, of course I had to bring my kids, so I invited my friend to come with so she could help watch them while I got my deal. 10 minutes to 10 she takes the older ones to get movies about a half a block away, leaving me with a kicking and screaming 2 year old. Ya, I went to find her to ask what's up with that? By the time I got back, the dealer putting a new sticker on the windows of unoccupied vehicles, the van was now $1200. I was pissed, knowing that I was 30 seconds too late for a much cheaper price. Still at $1200, it was a steal. About 25 minutes later I come back with the money, only to see the price is now 12,411. Seems the second deal was only good for half hour. So ya, I was moody yesterday, but I am hoping that today goes much better!! \n\nI hope YOU have a great day too!!
Hi. CTC as the name suggests is your total cost to company when you are employed. It means every single rupee the company spends on you is accounted here, including stututary obligations like the company's contribution to your PF and gratuity etc. Obviously cash in hand will be much lower. Whether 60-70% depends on what are the components of your CTC. The higher you grow up the corporate ladder the fringe benefits keep growing but the take home will not keep pace at the same rate. Some components of your CTC do attract fringe benefit tax.
If you have insurance deducted that might be what it is. I know one of my old pay stubs labeled it as cafeteria fund.

Hi there. Well it goes something like this, honestly\nWe all guys want 2 kinds of woman.\nWoman #1. A cute, sexy,slut for a girl friend who we can bang anytime and anywhere and anyway. We are like dogs always looking and always hopeing one will jump into our lap from on where and make all our dreams come true. This however is still a dream. When we see a cute pretty thing 9like yo0urself0 we are intermidated first by you cuties and 2nd we are thinking that someone so cute and pretty MUST be already taken and i am just to UGLY for her to consider me. We thus think oh darn, she is taken, must be a slut and is high maintance (we go ino the sour grape mode). Another reason why men musterbate so often and not admit it. \nWoman #2. A nice homely girl for a wife who we think will not walk out on us but satisfy our needs, be low maintance and give us kids and a woman who we can train in every way we want. (the woman # 1 is out of the question because we think is a slut for a wife thus we cant order and train her our way)\n\nSummary:. \n- You cant change or stop being cute and pretty so take matters into your own hand. If you see a cute guy, approch him and just talk, make him drool and want to go out with you because if you talk to him he will think his good for you otherwise you wouldnt approach him in the first place (build his self confideance before you refuse him sex...... ha ha ha).\nHope this helps.

Most businesses these days are connected to the internet and generally they are using permanently connected high speed lines. The lines mean that your employees have fast access to the internet and email.\n\nA firewall is a computer that sits between your business computers and the computers on the internet. It is designed to stop malicious data and people from getting into your business's private network.\n\nA firewall is normally configured to severely restrict access from the outside world, but let anything from the inside get out. For example you probably want people to be able to connect to your web server and see your website. You're probably less keen to let just anyone into your accounts server to see how you're doing!\n\nA firewall will\n- restrict outside access to your network to just the places you want other people to see\n- mitigate or prevent worms (think of it like a network based computer virus) from attacking and infesting your network\n- mitigate or prevent DOS (denial of service) attacks against your business network\n- allow you to restrict and control employees access to the internet (ie disallow applications you don't want your employees using, eg limewire or msn messenger)

People with Down's syndrome probably do not all look alike to those who know them personally. There are, however, physical characteristics that they have in common. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that was established at the moment of conception. Normally, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the fertilized egg. One of each pair is from the sperm and the other from the egg. In Down's there is an extra chromosome 21. The medical term is trisomy 21. This is the usual reason for Down's syndrome. \n\nThe most obvious consequenses of having an extra chromosome 21 are an epicanthal fold around the eyes, short stature, dental deformaties, broad chest (that's why they seem to look alike) and mental retardation. The epicanthal fold about the eyes give them an Asiatic or Mongoloian appearance, hence, the older term mongoloid. \n\nAs in any group of people, those with Down's exhibit different personalities and varied abilities.

With bolt temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun and shockwaves beaming out in all directions, lightning is a lesson in physical science and humility.\nBeyond its powerful beauty, lightning presents science with one of its greatest local mysteries: How does it work? It is common knowledge that lightning is generated in electrically charged storm systems, but the method of cloud charging still remains elusive.

Affordable Housing is sometimes referred to by gov't when they are approving a building project. When a developer wants to build a mega something and the town needs more housing for the lower income population they will require "affordable housing units" to be built. It is not uncommon to set aside a few units in luxury buildings as "affordable housing". While regular rent could be $2000 per month, the units set aside for low income might be half that.\n\nThere would be a criteria which would vary from city to city or state to state as to what 'low income' is. There is not a Federal standard.

Unfortunately its not that simply. You have to stop the HIV from actually effecting the DNA in the first place. Otherwise its just a back and forth game. I see where you're going with that thought and its a good one, but it wouldn't cure the HIV so it probably wouldn't be that effective of a method. Again, good thought though.

i find myself in an ideal position to answer this question.\n\nRecently me and my girlfriend had split up. We had been having sex while dating and now since we've broken up, we've decided that as long as we're single, we should enjoy the occasional sex (which is becoming more and more frequent). Most people will tell yo that to have sex you must be committed and it should be for love blah blah blah... \nI say this, if you both enjoy it and you both understand the rules, WHY NOT?

There is an old chinese saying. It goes something like this:\n\nFor a man to conquer a woman it is like breaking down a brick wall barehanded.\n\nFor a woman to catch a man it is like breaking through tissue paper.\n\nMoral of the story is that it is much easier for a woman to have many partners and much more difficult for the man.\n\nIt also has to do with religion and morals. The moral woman waits until marrage and only has sex with her husband. The immoral woman doesn't.\n\nSo I guess if the moral woman is jealous then she will call the immoral woman names to make herself feel better. (sour grapes is the medical term)\n\nMen lie about having sex many more times than they have ever had to make themselves seem better. To themselves and their friends. Most of the time they are lieing but a few tell the truth. They want you to care and envy them but now with all the diseases around. it's scary.\n\nI'm glad I went to Thailand in the 70's.

Maria Montessori's desire to help children was so strong, however, that in 1906 she gave up both her university chair and her medical practice to work with a group of sixty young children of working parents in the San Lorenzo district of Rome. It was there that she founded the first Casa dei Bambini, or "Children's House." What ultimately became the Montessori method of education developed there, based upon Montessori's scientific observations of these children's almost effortless ability to absorb knowledge from their surroundings, as well as their tireless interest in manipulating materials. Every piece of equipment, every exercise, every method Montessori developed was based on what she observed children to do "naturally," by themselves, unassisted by adults. \n\nChildren teach themselves. This simple but profound truth inspired Montessori's lifelong pursuit of educational reform, methodology, psychology, teaching, and teacher training--all based on her dedication to furthering the self-creating process of the child.

We'd all know exactly what the drug would do, how much is too much and what other drugs are to be avoided at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately they don't. And while it's relatively easy to find out about the various effects of illegal drugs it's less easy to find out about safe amounts or dangerous combinations.\n\nMixing drugs isn't a good idea. It makes the effects unpredictable and the risks harder to define.

HIV/AIDS can but NOT ALWAYS have flu like symptoms for 3 days to two weeks upon contracting it. After that time period, there are none. However, other diseases easily caught when someone's immune system is compromised are a telltale sign. They ususally appear in advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Caposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer, can appear in lesions on the skin. Thrush, or a yeast infection in the mouth can appear (looks like a thick white coating on the toungue). Pneumonia is common. Diarrhea for lengthy stretches is also common. Most people have no symptoms until AIDS develops fully, which is why it's important to get tested often so that HIV can be treated with drugs early.

How can you claim to love your wife if she cannot decide on her own what to do. She has to ask for permission before she can do anything, that won't be true love.\nThe kind of relationship God has with us as his children is different from the kind we have with our own, remember the bible says if we who are evil know how to give good gift to our children, how much more will God give good things to those who ask him.\n\nIf you had the power God has and his wisdom, i am sure you will have done the same. By the time you have stopped about 1 million people from doing what they want to do, even though you know its the best for them, they would label you a bully and a wicked god. If you think well about it, it is wiser to allow people decide what they want to do. They won't have the luxury of blaming you. Look at the case of Adam for example, he blamed God for giving him eve, that's why God now allows us to choose. I would like to talk to you more because it would not be possible on this forum, if you are interested, send me a message. My ID is tolumur@yahoo.com
happy feet is way better than flushed away, i babysit and i have seen both, trust me flushed away should be flushed away.
You might try a charitable association in Jamaica, or look up "philanthropists" or "Service Organizations" online.\n\nGood luck!
Otto von Guericke performed the Magdeburg experiment. He created the Magdeburg hemispheres, which were a pair of large copper hemispheres precisely cast so that their rims fit tightly together. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the resulting sphere contained the world's first artificial vacuum. \n\nGuericke's most famous performance (the Magdeburg Experiment) was carried out on 8 May 1654 before the Emperor Ferdinand III, and attracted crowds from all over Saxony. Before the emperor and a large crowd, Guericke greased the rims of the two hemispheres and carefully fitted them together. Then the local blacksmith began vigorously pumping the air from inside the sealed copper globe. After a while he was joined by his assistants, as the cranking of the pump gradually became more and more laborious.\n\nThe crowd then watched as a team of eight horses harnessed together was led into the square and attached to one hemisphere of the copper globe. Another team of eight horses was then attached to the other hemisphere. At a signal from Guericke, the two teams of horses strained forward in opposite directions, attempting to pull the two hemispheres apart, but no matter how hard they pulled, the horses could not separate the spheres. Guericke told the crowd that all that was holding the hemispheres together was the pressure of the air surrounding them. The vacuum inside the globe meant there was no opposing pressure to balance this great outer force. They were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nClick on the link below, which shows an illustration of the fantastic experiment.\n\nhttp://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/MAGDEB-S.gif\n\nHope this helps!
